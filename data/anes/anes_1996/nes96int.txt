     During the winter and early spring of 1997 the National Election Studies
staff and ICPSR prepared a comprehensive version of the 1996 American National
Election Study.  The number of cases in this file, 1714, includes all
respondents from the 1996 Pre- and Post-Election surveys.  About three-fourths
of these respondents or 1316 individuals also participated in the 1994
Post-Election survey (ICPSR 6507) or in both the 1992 American National
Election Survey (ICPSR 6067) and the 1994 Post-Election survey.

>> STUDY DESCRIPTION FOR THE AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY, 1996

     The 1996 American National Election Study was conducted by the Center for
Political Studies of the Institute for Social Research, under the general
direction of Steven J. Rosenstone, Donald R. Kinder and Warren E. Miller.  M.
Kathryn Cirksena was the Director of Studies for the National Election Studies
and oversaw the study from early planning stages through release of the 1996
data collection.  She was assisted by Santa Traugott, retiring Director of
Studies, Michael J. Horvath, and Daniel Unger. This is the twenty-fourth 
in a series of studies of American national elections produced by the
Center for Political Studies and the Survey Research Center, and it is
the tenth traditional time-series study to be conducted under the auspices of
National Science Foundation Grants (SBR-9317631, SES-9209410, SES-9009379,
SES-8808361, SES-8341310, SES-8207580 and SOC77-08885) providing long-term
support for the National Election Studies.  Since 1978, the National Election
Studies have been designed by a national Board of Overseers, the members of
which meet several times a year to plan content and administration of the
major study components.  Board members during the planning of the 1996
National Election Study included Larry Bartels (Princeton University), Gary
Cox (University of California, San Diego), Charles Franklin (University of
Wisconsin), Donald Kinder, ex officio (University of Michigan), David Leege,
Chair (University of Notre Dame), Warren Miller, ex officio (Arizona State
University), Wendy Rahn (University of Minnesota), as of September 1996, 
Steven Rosenstone, ex officio (University of Michigan), Virginia Sapiro 
(University of Wisconsin), W. Phillips Shively (University of Minnesota), 
Laura Stoker (University of California, Berkeley) and John Zaller (University
of California, Los Angeles).  As part of the study planning process, a special
planning committee was appointed, a pilot study conducted, and stimulus
letters sent to members of the scholarly community soliciting input on study
plans. Board member Larry Bartels chaired the Planning Committee for the 1996
National Election Study which included from the Board:  Donald Kinder
(Michigan), Warren Miller (Arizona State), Steven Rosenstone (Michigan),
Virginia Sapiro (Wisconsin), Laura Stoker (Berkeley), and John Zaller (UCLA)
and four other scholars, R. Michael Alvarez (Cal Tech), Jonathan Krosnick
(Ohio State), George Rabinowitz (North Carolina) and Wendy Rahn (Minnesota),
as well as Kathryn Cirksena and Santa Traugott (NES staff).

     A pilot study was carried out in September of 1995 for the purpose of
developing new instrumentation for the 1996 Election Study.  New items were
tested in the areas of the environment and environmental politics, media
exposure (including new media), issues, candidate evaluation, and new
questions included as part of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems. 
Data from the 1995 Pilot Study are available through the Inter-university
Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR 6636).  Results from the
Pilot Study (summarized in Appendix C "1995 Pilot Study Reports") were used by
the Planning Committee in formulating recommendations to the Board about study
content for the 1996 Pre- and Post-Election Survey.  Copies of the Pilot Study
Reports are available on the NES Website (www.umich.edu/~nes), or may be 
obtained by contacting the NES project staff.

>> 1996 STUDY DESIGN, CONTENT AND ADMINISTRATION
 
STUDY DESIGN 
     
     The 1996 National Election Study entailed both a pre-election interview
and a post-election re-interview.  About three-fourths of the 1996 cases
consist of empaneled respondents who were first interviewed in the 1994 or
1992 National Election Study.  A freshly drawn cross-section sample makes up
the balance of the 1996 cases.  (Details of the sample design are given in
"Sample Design of the 1996 Pre/Post Election Studies", in Appendix B.)
Altogether, 1714 citizens were interviewed in the 9 weeks prior to the
November 5, 1996 election. To permit analysis of the impact of the unfolding
election campaign, the pre-election sample was divided into four subsample
replicates, which were released approximately two weeks apart.  1316 of the
pre-election interviews were conducted with panel respondents; 398 with
cross-section respondents.  In the weeks following the election, 1534
pre-election respondents were reinterviewed: 1197 panel, 337 cross-section. 
This post-election survey included a mode experiment in which respondents were
randomly assigned to be interviewed either by telephone or face-to-face. 
Further details of the administration of the surveys are given in "Study
Administration", below.  
     The two components of the study -- the panel and the new cross-section --
were designed to be used together to create a combined nationally
representative sample of the American electorate.  The 1996 NES data set
includes a weight which incorporates sampling, nonresponse and post-
stratification factors, (V3), for analysis of the 1996 NES combined
sample (Panel component cases plus Cross-section supplement cases).  A Time
Series Weight (V5) which corrects for Panel attrition (but does not
incorporate sampling, nonresponse and post-stratification adjustments) should
be used in analyses comparing either the panel respondents or the combined
panel and new cross-section respondents to previous (unweighted) National
Election Studies data collections.  See "Sample Design of the 1996 Pre- and 
Post-Election Study" and the documentation for V3, and V5 for
further information.  The frequencies that appear in this codebook are 
unweighted.  A set of files, data, weights, and data documentation, designed
to enable panel analyses of the 1992-94-96 data become available sometime late
in 1997; announcements concerning the release of data for panel analysis are 
found at the NES website,  www.umich.edu/~nes.  The present release has been 
prepared for cross-section and time series analyses.

STUDY CONTENT

Substantive themes
     The content for the 1996 Election Study reflects its double duty, both as
the traditional presidential election year time-series data collection and as
a panel study.  Substantive themes represented in the 1996 questionnaires
include:
*  interest in the political campaigns; concern about the outcome; and 
   attentiveness to the media's coverage of the campaign      
*  information about politics       
*  evaluation of the presidential candidates and placement of presidential 
   candidates on various issue dimensions  
*  partisanship and evaluations of the political parties    
*  knowledge of and evaluation of House candidates
*  political participation:  turnout in the November general election; other
   forms of electoral campaign activity
*  vote choice for President, the U.S. House, and the U.S. Senate, including
   second choice for President    
*  personal and national economic well-being
*  positions on social welfare issues including:  government health insurance;
   federal budget priorities, and the role of the government in the provision 
   of jobs and good standard of living    
*  positions on social issues including:  abortion; women's roles; prayer in
   the schools; the rights of homosexuals and the death penalty        
*  racial and ethnic stereotypes; opinions on affirmative action; attitudes
   towards immigrants
*  opinions about the nation's most important problem
*  values and predispositions:  moral traditionalism; political efficacy; 
   egalitarianism; humanitarianism individualism; trust in government
*  social altruism and social connectedness       
*  feeling thermometers on a wide range of political figures and political 
   groups; affinity with various social groups  
*  detailed demographic information and measures of religious affiliation and
   religiosity.   

Several new themes are included in the 1996 study: 

THE CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN: To better understand the dynamics of congressional
campaigns, the pre-election wave contains a core battery of campaign-related
congressional items (including candidate recall, thermometer ratings,
ideological placements, and vote intention). 

ISSUE IMPORTANCE AND UNCERTAINTY: Several issue questions include
"uncertainty" and "importance" follow-ups for both respondent self-placements
("How certain are you of your position on this scale?" "How important is this
issue to you?") and candidate placements (e.g. "How certain are you of Bob
Dole's position on this scale?" "How important is this issue to Bob Dole?").

COMPARATIVE STUDY OF ELECTORAL SYSTEMS: An eight-minute module of questions
developed by a consortium of electoral scholars from 52 polities is included
in the post-election interview.  Designed to facilitate comparative analysis
of political attitudes and voting behavior, the same questions are being asked
in similar form in national election studies around the world, and the
resulting survey data will eventually be merged with contextual data on
electoral laws and political institutions to produce a rich cross-national
data set.  This module is included as questions T1-T16 in the post-election
survey.

ISSUE COVERAGE: New issue items in the areas of crime, the environment, gun
control, and income inequality are included.  A six-item battery carried
forward from the 1995 Pilot Study taps respondents' reactions to proposed
trade-offs among domestic spending, deficit reduction, and tax cuts.

THE ENVIRONMENT: New items from the 1995 Pilot Study tap perceptions of
environmental conditions (air quality and the safety of drinking water in the
nation and in the respondent's own community), environmental
priorities (ranging from global warming to cleaning up lakes and parks),
self-placements and placements of candidates and parties on environmental
issues (trading off environmental protection against jobs and living
standards, and supporting or opposing government environmental regulations on
businesses), and the relative effectiveness of national, state, and local
governments in dealing with environmental problems.

SOCIAL CAPITAL: Several measures of social connectedness are repeated from the
1992 survey.  Items tapping trust in people and trust in government are
repeated in the pre- and post-election waves to facilitate analysis of the
effect of the campaign and election on broader social attitudes.  A battery 
of items on membership and activity in a wide variety of social, political,
religious, and civic organizations is included in the post-election
questionnaire.  This battery includes several questions on as many as four
groups in each of twenty-two categories of organizations.  Because of the
large number of variables produced from these questions, two means of
accessing these data are provided; one set of variables which summarize the
groups data is available without any unusual effort by the user.  A full
complement of variables of interest to the specialist in groups membership and
participation is also readily available in a separate mergeable dataset
called the NES 1996 Auxuliary File: Group Membership.

MEDIA EXPOSURE: New media exposure, reception, and attention items developed
in the 1995 Pilot Study include talk radio items, more specific exposure
items for network and local television news, and reception items asking
respondents to match news anchors with the networks they work for.  A battery
of exposure items for entertainment television programs provides an indirect
measure of exposure to campaign advertisements. There is also a new open-ended
item on recollection of a memorable campaign ad, some expansion and
reorganization of items tapping attention to the campaign in various media.



Congressional Ballot Cards, Candidate Lists, and Candidate Numbers
    
     In the usual NES Post-Election survey, and for 1996, in the Pre-Election
survey as well, respondents are asked several questions about their particular
Congressperson and Senators.  In previous years, interviewers pre-edited
questionnaires to fill in the names appropriate for the state and
congressional district in which the respondent was living (or was living
during the pre-election interview).  The use of Computer-Assisted Interviewing
software means that information about respondents' congressional district and
about candidates and incumbents names (including retiring incumbents) and
parties is maintained and periodically updated in a computerized database;
this information is loaded into the laptop computers used by interviewers and
accessed to provide the correct CD and candidate information for displaying
and entering responses to the relevant questions.  Each candidate and Senator
is assigned a unique number that reflects his or her incumbency status and
party.   Particular questions in the survey, which include feeling
thermometers for the various candidates, automatically appear on 
screen with the correct name filled in.  The Candidate Lists stored in 
the database, which show which candidates are associated with which
congressional district and with which numbers they are tagged, can also
be found here, as can a sample ballot card.  Candidates' names were identified
by referring to the results of primary elections published in Congressional
Quarterly.  In the Pre-Election survey there is the additional complication
that a number of states held their Congressional primaries after the
Pre-Election field work had started.  In these cases, the names of those
candidates with the greatest chance of winning their party's nomination were
loaded into the database.  Forecasts of likely winners assumed that incumbents
were likely to win their primaries and that unopposed non-incumbents would
win.  Other races were forecast by Board member Charles Franklin, using a
probit model of all 1996 contested primacies involving non-incumbents and
utilizing FEC data from August 1, 1996.  As soon as the outcome of the primary
was known, the correct candidate information was entered into the database and
the new version was loaded onto the appropriate interviewers' laptop
computers.  In nearly all races the forecasted winner was correct.  Further
details can be found at the documentation for Pre-Election questions B2a and
B2b.      



Features of a CAI questionnaire

     Using the capabilities of computer-assisted interviewing (CAI) in the
1996 NES enabled the introduction of several features that would not be
feasible using a paper-and-pencil questionnaire.  The most significant of
these for users of this data are: randomization within batteries or sequences
of questions; application of half-sampling to some questions; and random order
of presentation of blocks of questions.  Randomization within batteries refers
to presenting, in a randomly determined order, a series of questions about the
same objects (or people).  An example would be the questions about the
respondent's likes and dislikes of the three main Presidential candidates
where the names of Clinton, Dole and Perot were inserted randomly as the
first, second or third person to be asked about in this series.  Randomization
of names/objects in this way avoids ordering effects that might be obtained
if, for example, the candidates were always asked about in the same order in
every series of questions where a parallel question is asked about each of the
three.  Questions where randomization of order within a series was in force
are clearly identified in the codebook.  Randomization variables, which allow
the user to identify the order of presentation, are provided for all instances
of randomized presentation.  A few questions, primarily open-ended questions,
were half-sampled, so that a randomly selected half of respondents were asked
the question.  Finally, an order experiment, where a sequence of closed-ended
questions was asked early in the interview for a random half of respondents
and late in the interview for the other half, was included as part of the mode
comparison experiment described below.  For both of these features, the
relevant codebook entries contain explanatory notes.  All random
selections were programmed into the computer application of the questionnaire
and occurred automatically and independently of other circumstances of the
interview.  CAI eliminates the preparation of a paper and pencil version
which would previously have been published in the codebook.



STUDY ADMINISTRATION

     Interviewing for the pre-election survey began on September 3, 1996 and
concluded on November 4, 1996.  The average length of interview in the
pre-election survey was 74 minutes.  The overall response rate was 71%.  (See
"Response Rates" below for a complete discussion.)  The post-election
interviewing occurred between November 6 and December 31, 1996 inclusive, with
an average interview length of 70 minutes.  The overall reinterview rate was
90%, with further details available in the Response Rate section below.

Sample "Releases" in the Pre-election survey

     Both parts of the sample (panel and cross-section) were randomly
subdivided into four quarter sample releases, each of which is a proper,
random subsample of the NES sample.  Two additional 'reserve' replicates of
cross-section cases were held in abeyance until it was determined that the
additional sample lines would be needed to attain study goals.  Replicates 1
through 4 were considered the "base sample," certain to be released.  The
release dates for sample replicates were:

     Replicate           Date of release
     1                   September 3, 1996   
     2                   September 12, 1996
     3                   September 26, 1996
     4                   October 10, 1996
     5 (Reserve)         September 26, 1996 (with replicate 3)
     6 (Reserve)         October 10, 1996 (with replicate 4)


For a full description of the sample design and implementation, see the 1996 NATIONAL
PRE/POST-ELECTION STUDY SAMPLE DESIGN.

Pre-election study: assignment to telephone mode

     One of the administrative problems in fielding a panel study is that
respondents have had an intervening period of time in which to relocate,
perhaps at some remove from areas where field study staff are available to
interview them.  We estimated that between 40 and 80 respondents might have
moved to areas in which SRC did not have interviewers in the field.  Our
priority was to interview as many panel respondents as possible, but we did
not want to incur the additional costs associated with interviewer travel. 
Accordingly, panel respondents who had moved 'out-of-range' for a face-to-face
interview were converted to phone mode.  The criterion set for deciding if a
case was 'out-of-range' was 90 minutes driving time one-way from the
interviewer's home to the respondent's address under local usual driving
conditions.  The total number of panel respondents that we interviewed who
were "out of range" for this reason was 47.

Post-Election Mode Experiment: Design and Implementation

     In contrast with the usual NES practice of conducting all post-election
interviews in person, half of the respondents in the post-election wave of the
1996 survey were interviewed by telephone, with post-election respondents 
randomly assigned (except in extreme circumstances) to phone or face-to-face 
administration.  The telephone mode used the same computerized questionnaire
developed for the face-to-face post-election interviews and was conducted by
the same interviewers.  The mode experiment provides a direct comparison of 
the effects of mode of interview on important indicators of data quality and
comparability.
     Cases were assigned to either telephone or face-to-face mode at the
sample segment level.  Every effort to retain randomly assigned cases in their
assigned mode was made.  Respondents who had been interviewed by telephone in
the pre-election study were disqualified from random assignment to mode; all
those reinterviews were done by telephone, a total of 47 cases.  Respondents
who did not have telephones and respondents who were not able to participate
in the mode experiment because of a physical limitation that prevented them 
from being interviewed by one mode or another were also excluded, which
totaled 130 additional cases (24 of these were completed by telephone).  No
changes in mode of interview because of respondent preference or for ease of 
administration were permitted.
     All prospective respondents received two incentives in the mail: a check
for $10 and a small gift.  Included in the mailing to telephone mode
respondents was a sealed respondent booklet with the candidate ballot folded
inside.  The contact letter instructed respondents to set these materials
aside until told to open them by the interviewer.  Interviewers followed
procedures to ascertain that respondents were using the booklet and ballot
card appropriately and to note deviations from the instructions.  


     
Evaluation of problems in study implementation

     Two implementation problems arose in the post-election field
administration.  This resulted in two unintended systematic deviations from
standard administration.  145 cases in the phone mode were mailed a respondent
booklet that included the wrong ballot card.  As soon as this problem was
discovered, new respondent booklets with correct ballot cards were mailed by
overnight mail to these respondents.  Approximately 50 interviews were 
conducted where the respondent had the incorrect ballot card; in these cases
interviewers read the correct ballot card information to the respondent.  
A full report to be issued will analyze these data to identify any systematic
differences related to this implementation error.  It was discovered early in
the data collection period that 39 interviews were completed using the
training version of the survey instrument, due to a technical problem in
transmitting files to the field.  The training version contained no randomized
presentation of questions and lacked several last minute changes to the
interview.  Call-backs to 37 of these 39 respondents allowed us to collect
data on the several missed questions.  A report analyzing these cases for
differential impact of the use of the training questionnaire is in
preparation.



RESPONSE RATES    

     The response rate in the pre-election study was 71%.  Among panel
respondents the response (reinterview) rate was 76%; among cross-section
respondents it was 60%.   
     The overall reinterview/response rate in the post-election interviewing
was 90%.  Among panel respondents in the post-election survey, the response
rate was 91% and among cross-section respondents it was 85%.  The response
rate in face-to-face mode (including all cases in this mode, experimentally
assigned and excluded) was 89% and for telephone mode it was 91%.



INTERVIEW COMPLETION RATE    
 
     Completion rates for the pre-election sample releases, for pre-election
time periods, and for post-election time periods are presented here.  Table 1
presents the percentage completions per quarter sample replicate (replicates 3
and 4 include the reserve cases added to those replicates); table 2 shows the
percentage of completions per two week time period in the pre-election survey. 
Table 3 lays out the number of interviews taken for each week elapsing after
the Nov. 5 General Election.  In 1996, 29% of the interviews were completed in
the first week after the election and 86% in the first three weeks; progress
was evenly divided between face-to-face and telephone modes.

>> 1996 FILE STRUCTURE

     The AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY, 1996 PRE- AND POST-ELECTION
SURVEY are available in logical record length (LRECL) format.  The data are
sorted in ascending order by respondent number, and contain 1,657 variables
for 1714 respondents.

The machine-readable codebook, which provides complete formatting and other
information for all variables accompanies the data.  In addition, a set of SAS
and SPSS control statements has been prepared for this collection.  The
control statements contain formatting information as well as variable labels,
value labels and missing data specifications for all variables in the
collection.

The data can also be accessed directly through software packages that do not
use SAS or SPSS control statements by specifying the record locations of the
desired variables.  The record locations for all variables are provided in the
codebook.


NOTES ON CONFIDENTIALITY

     Starting with the 1986 Election Study, NES has released occupation code
variables in somewhat less detail than in years past.  This dataset includes a
two-digit code with 71 categories corresponding to Census Bureau occupational
groupings.  Those who need the full occupation code for their research should
contact the NES project staff for information about the conditions under
which access may be provided.  Similarly, the National Election Studies have
not included information for census tracts or minor civil divisions since
1978.  Permission to use the more detailed geographic information for
scholarly research may be obtained from the Board of Overseers.  More
information about this is available from NES project staff. Coding of the new
religious denomination variable is in some cases based on an alphabetic
"other, please specify" variable.  This variable is restricted for reasons of
confidentiality, but access may be provided to legitimate scholars under
established NES procedures.     


OPEN-ENDED MATERIALS  

     Traditionally, the National Election Studies have contained several
minutes of open-ended responses (for example, the candidate likes and
dislikes).  These questions are put into Master Codes by the SRC coding
section.  Other scholars have developed alternative or supplemental coding
schemes for the questions (for example, the levels of conceptualization,
released as ICPSR 8151).  The Board of Overseers wishes to encourage these
efforts but in ways which respect the NES and SRC obligation to protect the
privacy and anonymity of respondents.  Circumstances under which individuals
may have access to transcribed versions of these questions have been worked
out and those interested should contact the NES project staff for further
details.  



>>1996 SPECIAL NOTE - CHANGES IN CODING BETWEEN PRE AND POST

Several questions which were asked in the Pre-election interview and then
asked again in the Post-Election interview had some differences between
the versions used.

Variables where pre and post codes (and some code labels) don't match on
repeated questions:

Pre       Post

960369      1273   (code 4 label; Respon. booklet identical both waves)
960371      1275   (  "  "  "       "       "         "      "     "  )
960370      1274   (  "  "  "       "       "         "      "     "  )
960375      1277   (  "  "  "       "       "         "      "     "  )
960376      1278   (  "  "  "       "       "         "      "     "  )
960377      1279   (  "  "  "       "       "         "      "     "  )
960378      1280   (  "  "  "       "       "         "      "     "  )
960566      1251   (code 7 in Pre; code 4 in Post)
960569      1259   (codes 1,2 in Pre; codes 1,5 in Post)

For variables 960369-371,960375-378 / 961273-1275,961277-1280 (7-point
liberal-conservative scale questions) the differences appeared onscreen 
to the interviewer but the labeled Respondent Booklet was accurate (complete
code 4 label) and identical for both interviews.




>> NEW WEIGHTS FOR THE 1996 STUDY (RELEASED MARCH 1998)

The steps taken to address the 1996 NES overestimation of voting in the 1996
presidential election resulted in the development of post-stratified weights
which account for individual selection probability, geographic related
household nonresponse, and misrepresentation of any age by education
subgroups.  These revised, CPS-standardized weights were computed for the 1992
NES Pre and Post (1992 fresh cross-section component), the 1994 NES Post and
the 1996 NES Pre and Post Election data sets.  Users of previous weights
released with the 1994 and 1996 data will find that these weights extend and
combine the features of previously released weights (the 1992 weight will be
incorporated into the forthcoming 1992-1994-1996 Combined File).

V960005a and V960005b, the two new weight variables for 1996, are released for
the first time with this version of the 1996 NES data.  A review of the
findings that led to the construction of these new weights and full details of
their development and effect are described in Appendix G, "Post-Stratified
Cross-sectional Analysis Weights for the 1992, 1994 and 1996 NES Data."  The
recommendation to explore developing these weights was made by Warren Miller
and Merrill Shanks and authorized by the NES Board of Overseers at its
September 1997 meeting.  The SRC Sampling Section, under the direction of
Steve Heeringa, completed the work and the technical report in consultation
with the NES Director of Studies.

There are two weights, one to be applied to the pre-election sample (V960005a)
and the other which is for use with the post-election sample  (V960005b).  The
post-election sample weight takes into account attrition that occurred between
the pre- and post-election surveys.    In analyses using variables from the
pre- and post-election data, the post-election weight should be applied.  Use
of either weight is appropriate only for the full sample, cross-section and
panel cases combined.  



>> 1996 CODEBOOK INFORMATION

The format for the NES 1996 codebook differs from that of previous years
due to changes in production mode; the codebook is no longer Osiris-generated.
However, there are close similarities to the Osiris-generated codebooks
of past studies.  An example of a 1996 codebook (variable) record appears
below with some explanatory material.  The annotations refer to portions
of the codebook record according to the numbers [1] - [10]

..............................................................................

[1] This is the variable name according to the SAS and SPSS data definition
files which accompany the raw data.  Most of the names begin with 'V' followed
by a number.  

[2] This describes whether the variable is character or numeric.  If a numeric
variable has decimal places, it appears below the variable type.  If a numeric
variable has no indication for decimal places, then there are 0 decimal
places.

[3] Column locations (beginning and ending) in the raw ASCII data file are
provided.

[4] Missing values, if they appear, identify the codes which are 
by default assigned to missing data in the SAS and SPSS data definition
files which accompany the raw ASCII data.  In the example above, the value
9 is considered missing data and is so assigned in the SAS and SPSS data
definition files.  If two missing data values appear, the second will appear
preceded by "GE" to designate that codes equal to or greater than it are
missing data.

[5] This is the question number.  The survey questions have alphanumeric
numbering (e.g. A1); the processing and administration variables have question
numbers which are identified with the type of variable, for example, Iwr.1 is
the first variable describing the interviewer.

[6]  This is the question text for the administered question; it can also be,
as in this example, a description of the processing or administration
variable.  All question text appears above the dashed line.

[7]  Explanatory notes or other material provided by NES may appear below the
dashed line, preceding the code values.

[8] These are the frequency counts for the code values.  The frequency counts
are unweighted in 1996.

[9] These are the code values representing response categories used for the
question.

[10] These are the code labels for the numbered response categories (code
values).  "DK" is equivalent to "don't know," "NA" represents "not
ascertained" and "INAP" indicates "inappropriate" (not applicable).>> 1996 VARIABLE DESCRIPTION LIST
