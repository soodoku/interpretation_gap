>> 1982 STUDY DESCRIPTION


           THE NES/CPS AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY, 1982, WAS
      CONDUCTED BY THE CENTER FOR POLITICAL STUDIES OF THE
      INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH, THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,
      UNDER THE OVERALL DIRECTION OF WARREN E. MILLER.  MARIA
      ELENA SANCHEZ WAS DIRECTOR OF STUDIES IN 1982. SHE WAS
      ASSISTED BY JEANNE CASTRO AND ALICE HAYES WHO HAD PRIMARY
      RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONDUCT OF FIELD AND CODING
      OPERATIONS, RESPECTIVELY.  THIS IS THE SEVENTEENTH IN A
      SERIES OF STUDIES OF AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTIONS PRODUCED BY
      THE POLITICAL BEHAVIOR PROGRAM OF THE SURVEY RESEARCH CENTER
      (SRC) AND THE CENTER FOR POLITICAL STUDIES (CPS), AND THE
      THIRD STUDY TO BE CONDUCTED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE
      NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION WITH FUNDING FROM A GRANT (NO.
      SES-8207580) WHICH CONTINUES LONG-TERM SUPPORT FOR THE
      NATIONAL ELECTION STUDIES.

           A BOARD OF OVERSEERS DRAWN FROM THE NATIONAL COMMUNITY
      OF SOCIAL SCIENTISTS EXISTS TO SUPERVISE THE IMPLEMENTATION
      OF THE GRANT, SET PRIORITIES FOR FUTURE STUDIES, AND LINK
      MEMBERS OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCE COMMUNITY TO THE NATIONAL
      ELECTION STUDIES.  AS IN 1978 AND 1980, THE BOARD PLAYED AN
      ACTIVE ROLE IN PLANNING THE DESIGN AND CONTENT OF THE 1982
      STUDY.

           THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD DURING THE PLANNING AND
      EXECUTION PHASES OF THE 1982 STUDY WAS AS FOLLOWS:
      PROFESSORS RAYMOND E. WOLFINGER, CHAIR, UNIVERSITY OF
      CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY; RICHARD A. BRODY, STANFORD UNIVERSITY;
      HEINZ EULAU, STANFORD UNIVERSITY; STANLEY KELLY, JR.,
      PRINCETON UNIVERSITY; DONALD R. KINDER, UNIVERSITY OF
      MICHIGAN; DAVID R. MAYHEW, YALE UNIVERSITY; WARREN E.
      MILLER, ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY, EX OFFICIO; MILDRED A.
      SCHWARTZ, UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS, CHICAGO CIRCLE; DAVID O.
      SEARS, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES; AND J. MERRILL
      SHANKS, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY.

           PLANNING FOR THE 1982 STUDY WAS GREATLY DELAYED DUE TO
      BUDGETARY UNCERTAINTY AT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
      WITH RESPECT TO THE LEVEL OF SUPPORT TO BE RECEIVED BY NES
      FROM THIS ORGANIZATION.  AS A RESULT, THE 1982 STUDY DESIGN
      WAS LARGELY THE RESULT OF DELIBERATIONS BETWEEN THE BOARD OF
      OVERSEERS AND THE PROJECT STAFF, WITH LESS INVOLVEMENT THAN
      USUAL FROM THE COMMUNITY OF OUTSIDE SCHOLARS.  AN AD HOC
      1982 STUDY PLANNING COMMITTEE WAS APPOINTED BY THE BOARD IN
      FEBRUARY 1982 TO FORMULATE RECOMMENDATIONS ON SURVEY
      INSTRUMENTATION AND CONTEXTUAL DATA COLLECTIONS.  THE
      COMMITTEE MET ONCE IN LATE MARCH TO DEFINE THE BASIC
      CONTENTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY.

           THE COMMITTEE WAS CHAIRED BY PROFESSOR RAYMOND
      WOLFINGER AND CONSISTED OF: TWO ADDITIONAL BOARD MEMBERS,
      PROFESSORS DAVID SEARS AND MERRILL SHANKS; CONGRESSIONAL
      SCHOLARS, PROFESSORS DAVID W. BRADY, JOHN FEREJOHN, MORRIS
      P. FIORINA, AND GARY C. JACOBSON; AND PROFESSOR WARREN
      MILLER, EX OFFICIO.
           THE NES BOARD WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEFINITION OF
      CORE QUESTIONNAIRE ITEMS TO SUPPORT THE NATIONAL ELECTIONS
      TIME SERIES.  FINAL CORE ITEM SELECTIONS WERE PARTLY BASED
      ON PREFERENCES VOICED BY THE USER COMMUNITY IN RESPONSE TO A
      MEMORANDUM SENT IN 1979 TO THE APPROXIMATELY 900 PERSONS ON
      THE NES MAILING LIST.  THE BOARD WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR
      REVIEWING THE INSTRUMENTATION OF THE CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS
      TIMES SERIES STARTED IN 1978.  FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS
      FROM THE PLANNING COMMITTEE, THE BOARD APPROVED THE
      REPETITION IN THE TRADITIONAL POST-ELECTION SURVEY OF A
      SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF CONGRESSIONAL ITEMS USED IN THE 1978
      AND 1980 NES/CPS ELECTION STUDIES.




>> 1982 - DESIGN OF THE NES/CPS AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY


           THE 1982 ELECTION STUDY HAS TWO COMPONENTS:

           (1)  A TRADITIONAL POST-ELECTION SURVEY USING IN-PERSON
           INTERVIEWS WITH A NATIONAL SAMPLE OF 1418 RESPONDENTS
           LOCATED IN THE 74 PRIMARY AREAS OF THE COUNTY-BASED SRC
           SAMPLING FRAME, AND

           (2)  AN EXPERIMENTAL POST-ELECTION SURVEY USING
           COMPUTER-ASSISTED TELEPHONE INTERVIEWING (CATI) WITH A
           NATIONAL SAMPLE OF 1000 RESPONDENTS SELECTED BY A
           RANDOM-DIGIT DIALING PROCEDURE.

           INTERVIEWING FOR THE IN-PERSON AND TELEPHONE SURVEYS
      STARTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER ELECTION DAY AND EXTENDED THROUGH
      JANUARY 1983.  TELEPHONE RESPONDENTS WERE ADMINISTERED A
      SOMEWHAT ABBREVIATED VERSION OF THE IN-PERSON INTERVIEW
      SCHEDULE, ADAPTED FOR USE OVER THE TELEPHONE WHERE
      APPROPRIATE.

           SRC FIELD INTERVIEWERS CONDUCTED THE IN-PERSON SURVEY,
      AS IN PAST ELECTION STUDIES.  THE TELEPHONE STUDY INVOLVED
      THE USE OF MATCHED HALF-SAMPLES, AND THE COLLABORATION OF
      TWO SURVEY ORGANIZATIONS:  MICHIGAN'S SURVEY RESEARCH CENTER
      AND BERKELEY'S COMPUTER-ASSISTED SURVEY METHODS GROUP. EACH
      OF THE SURVEY ORGANIZATIONS ADMINISTERED A COMPARABLE
      QUESTIONNAIRE VERSION UNDER THEIR DIFFERENT CATI SYSTEMS,
      INTERVIEWING A RANDOM HALF OF THE RESPONDENTS FROM EACH OF
      THE SAMPLED TELEPHONE CLUSTERS.

           THE IN-PERSON/TELEPHONE METHODOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT OF
      THE 1982 STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS A VARIETY OF
      SUBSTANTIVE, MEASUREMENT AND PROCEDURAL ISSUES SUCH AS:  THE
      VIABILITY OF A METHOD DEVELOPED TO IDENTIFY THE
      CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF TELEPHONE RESPONDENTS; DIFFERENCES
      IN SAMPLE COVERAGE AND RESPONSE RATE BETWEEN INTERVIEWING
      MODES; QUALITATIVE MODE DIFFERENCES RESULTING FROM THE
      ADAPTATION TO TELEPHONE ADMINISTRATION OF TRADITIONALNES00000
      QUESTIONS RELYING ON "SHOW CARDS" AND OTHER VISUAL AIDS, AND
      THE FEASIBILITY OF ADMINISTERING LONG (50-55 MINUTES)
      POLITICAL INTERVIEWS OVER THE TELEPHONE.

           SUMMARIZED INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIELD ADMINISTRATION
      FOR THE IN-PERSON SURVEY IS PRESENTED BELOW:

>> 1982 SAMPLING INFORMATION - IN-PERSON POST-ELECTION SURVEY


           DATA FOR THE 1982 NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY WERE OBTAINED
      BY INTERVIEWING, IN-PERSON, INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN HOUSEHOLDS
      IN THE COTERMINOUS UNITED STATES, EXCLUSIVE OF HOUSEHOLDS ON
      MILITARY RESERVATONS.  THE ELIGIBLE POPULATION CONSISTED OF
      UNITED STATES CITIZENS WHO WERE 18 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER BY
      ELECTION DAY, 1982.

           IN 1978 AND 1980, THE NES SAMPLING FRAME CONSISTED OF
      108 CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS.  IN 1982, BECAUSE OF
      REDISTRICTING, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO OBTAIN THE REQUIRED
      STATISTICAL INFORMATION IN TIME TO DRAW A SAMPLE OF NEW
      CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS.  THEREFORE, THE TRADITIONAL
      POST-ELECTION SURVEY SAMPLE WAS DRAWN FROM THE COUNTY-BASED
      SRC SAMPLING FRAME, WITH THE 1982 CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT
      NUMBERS SUBSEQUENTLY IDENTIFIED FOR EACH SAMPLED SEGMENT
      FROM INSPECTION OF REDISTRICTED CONGRESSIONAL MAPS.  TIMELY
      IDENTIFICATION OF THE DISTRICT NUMBER CORRESPONDING TO EACH
      SAMPLE SEGMENT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE CONGRESSIONAL TIME
      SERIES, INASMUCH AS THE ADMINISTRATION OF THIS BATTERY OF
      QUESTIONS REQUIRES THAT INTERVIEWERS PRE-EDIT IN THE
      QUESTIONNAIRES THE NAMES OF THE CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES
      THAT RAN IN THE RESPONDENT'S DISTRICT. THERE ARE 173
      CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS IN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS REPRESENTED
      IN THE 1982 SAMPLE.

           THE 1982 STUDY EMPLOYS THE SURVEY RESEARCH CENTER'S
      NATIONAL SAMPLE OF COUNTIES AND SMSA'S.  THE 74 PRIMARY
      AREAS OF THE SRC NATIONAL SAMPLE INCLUDE 12 MAJOR
      METROPOLITAN AREAS, 32 OTHER STANDARD METROPOLITAN
      STATISTICAL AREAS (SMSA'S) AND 30 COUNTIES OR COUNTY-GROUPS
      REPRESENTING THE NONMETROPOLITAN OR RURAL PORTIONS OF THE
      COUNTRY.  IN THE MULTISTAGE AREA PROBABILITY SAMPLING,
      FIRST-STAGE STRATIFICATION OF SMSA'S AND COUNTIES IS CARRIED
      OUT INDEPENDENTLY WITHIN EACH OF THE FOUR MAJOR GEOGRAPHICAL
      REGIONS, NORTHEAST, NORTH CENTRAL, SOUTH, AND WEST, EACH OF
      WHICH RECEIVES REPRESENTATION IN PROPORTION TO ITS
      POPULATION.

           OVER ALL REGIONS, THE SMSA'S AND COUNTIES ARE ASSIGNED
      TO 74 RELATIVELY HOMOGENEOUS GROUPS OR STRATA.  TWELVE OF
      THESE STRATA CONTAIN ONLY ONE PRIMARY AREA EACH; THESE ARE
      THE TWO STANDARD CONSOLIDATED AREAS AND THE 10 LARGEST
      SMSA'S, OUTSIDE THE CONSOLIDATED AREAS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED
      WITH CERTAINTY.  THE REMAINING 62 STRATA AVERAGE A LITTLE
      OVER TWO MILLION POPULATION AND MAY CONTAIN FROM 2 TO 200 OR
      MORE PRIMARY AREAS (SMSA'S OR COUNTY GROUPS).  FROM EACH
      STRATUM ONE PRIMARY AREA IS SELECTED WITH PROBABILITY
      PROPORTIONATE TO POPULATION.  THIS SAMPLING PROCESS LEADS TO
      APPROXIMATELY EQUAL SAMPLE SIZES FROM THESE 62 PRIMARY
      SAMPLE AREAS.

           INSTEAD OF INDEPENDENT SELECTIONS WITHIN EACH OF THE 62
      STRATA, CONTROLLED PROBABILITY SELECTION IS INTRODUCED FOR A
      MORE EFFICIENT SAMPLE.  WITHIN EACH OF THE FOUR GEOGRAPHIC
      REGIONS THE SELECTIONS OF PRIMARY AREAS ARE LINKED BY A
      PROCEDURE THAT CONTROLS THE DISTRIBUTION OF SAMPLE AREAS BY
      STATES AND DEGREE OF URBANIZATION BEYOND THE CONTROLS
      EFFECTED THROUGH THE FORMATION OF THE 62 STRATA.  THIS
      CONTROLLED SELECTION YIELDS A MORE BALANCED SAMPLE AND
      INCREASES THE PRECISION OF SAMPLE ESTIMATES.

           AS THE MULTISTAGE AREA SAMPLING CONTINUES WITHIN THE 74
      PRIMARY UNITS, THE AREA IS DIVIDED AND SUBDIVIDED, IN TWO TO
      FIVE STAGES, INTO SUCCESSIVELY SMALLER SAMPLING UNITS.  BY
      DEFINITION AND PROCEDURE, EACH DWELLING BELONGS UNIQUELY TO
      ONE SAMPLING UNIT AT EACH STAGE.  WITHIN THE PRIMARY AREAS,
      CITIES, TOWNS, AND RURAL AREAS ARE THE SECONDARY SELECTIONS.
      BLOCKS OR CLUSTERS OF ADDRESSES IN CITIES AND TOWNS, AND
      CHUNKS OF RURAL AREAS ARE THE THIRD-STAGE UNITS.  IN A
      FOURTH-STAGE THERE IS A SELECTION OF SMALL SEGMENTS OR
      CLUSTERS OF DWELLINGS WHERE INTERVIEWS ARE TAKEN FOR A
      STUDY.  IN A LAST STAGE OF SAMPLING, ONE RESPONDENT IS
      SELECTED FROM AMONG ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS.

           PROBABILITY SELECTION IS ENFORCED AT ALL STAGES OF THE
      SAMPLE SELECTION; THE INTERVIEWER HAS NO FREEDOM OF CHOICE
      AMONG DWELLINGS OR AMONG HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS WITHIN A SAMPLE
      DWELLING.

           AT THE OVERALL RATE OF 1:35,360 A SAMPLE OF 2,278
      HOUSING UNITS WAS DRAWN.  THESE ARE THE DWELLINGS WHERE
      INTERVIEWERS CALLED IN 1982 TO ATTEMPT INTERVIEWS WITH ONE
      OBJECTIVELY SELECTED ELIGIBLE PERSON.  THE SELECTIONS WERE
      THINLY SPREAD, AVERAGING ONLY ONE OR TWO FROM A SAMPLE
      BLOCK.  IN HOUSEHOLDS WITH ELIGIBLE PERSONS, AN INTERVIEW
      WAS COMPLETED WITH THE HOUSEHOLD MEMBER DESIGNATED AS THE
      RESPONDENT THROUGH AN OBJECTIVE SELECTION PROCEDURE ALLOWING
      FOR NO SUBSTITUTIONS.




>> 1982 CONTENTS


           THE FOCUS OF THE SURVEY WAS THE JUST-HELD CONGRESSIONAL
      ELECTIONS.  RESPONDENTS WERE ASKED ABOUT THEIR INVOLVEMENT
      AND INTEREST IN THE CAMPAIGN, WHETHER AND HOW THEY VOTED,
      THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF CONTACT WITH THEIR U.S.
      REPRESENTATIVE, AND ABOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF ISSUE POSITIONS
      HELD BY CANDIDATES FOR CONGRESS.

           A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS DEALT WITH PRESIDENT REAGAN'S
      PERFORMANCE IN OFFICE.  IN ADDITION, THE RESPONDENTS WERE
      ASKED TO EVALUATE REAGAN'S PERSONAL QUALITIES, AND THEIR OWN
      FEELINGS TOWARD HIM.

           OTHER VARIABLES INCLUDE FEELING THERMOMETERS, PARTY
      IDENTIFICATION, MAJOR NATIONAL PROBLEMS, ATTITUDES ON A
      NUMBER OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ISSUES, AND PERSONAL DATA:
      EMPLOYMENT, INCOME, RELIGION, AGE, EDUCATION, MARITAL
      STATUS, AND SOCIAL CLASS.

           THE PRESENT RELEASE OF THE DATA INCLUDES FIELD
      ADMINISTRATION AND SAMPLING VARIABLES, AS WELL AS SEVERAL
      KINDS OF DERIVED MEASURES: OCCUPATIONAL PRESTIGE SCORES
      (DUNCAN, NORC) FOR RESPONDENT, HEAD, AND WIFE OF HEAD AND
      SEPARATE EDUCATIONAL AND OCCUPATIONAL SERIES PRESENTING DATA
      FOR HEAD AND WIFE OF HEAD SEPARATE FROM RESPONDENT.

      SPECIAL INFORMATION: ABOUT THE -------------------
                                     (NAME # X, Y, OR Z)
         EXPRESSIONS IN THE 1982 QUESTIONNAIRE

           THE 1982 ELECTION STUDY QUESTIONNAIRE MADE PROVISIONS
      TO HAVE INTERVIEWERS FILL IN DISTRICT/STATE CANDIDATE NAMES
      IN BLANK SLOTS LIKE THE ONE DEPICTED ABOVE.  A COMPREHENSIVE
      LIST OF HOUSE, SENATE AND GOVERNOR CANDIDATE AND INCUMBENT
      NAMES WAS PREPARED FOR EACH OF THE 173 DISTRICTS IN THE
      SAMPLE AND THE INTERVIEWERS USED THE LISTS TO PRE-EDIT NAMES
      WHERE APPROPRIATE, DEPENDING ON THE DISTRICT OF INTERVIEW.
      THESE CANDIDATE LISTS ARE REPRODUCED IN NOTE 4 IN THE NOTES
      SECTION.

           THE (NAME #) EXPRESSION WILL GENERALLY LIST MORE THAN
      ONE CANDIDATE NUMBER.  FOR ANY GIVEN DISTRICT, HOWEVER, ONE
      OF TWO POSSIBILITIES WILL HOLD:  1)  THERE WILL BE ONE AND
      ONLY ONE NAME IN THE DISTRICT CANDIDATE LIST QUALIFYING FOR
      INCLUSION ON THE BASIS OF THE NUMBERS LISTED IN THE
      EXPRESSION; OR 2) THERE WILL BE NO NUMBER IN THE DISTRICT
      CANDIDATE LIST MATCHING ANY OF THE NUMBERS IN THE
      EXPRESSION.  AN INSTANCE OF NO MATCHING NUMBERS ARISES FOR A
      QUESTION ABOUT THE CANDIDATE CHALLENGING A DISTRICT
      INCUMBENT WHEN, IN FACT, THE INCUMBENT IS RUNNING UNOPPOSED.
      INTERVIEWERS WERE INSTRUCTED TO MARK "NO INFO" THOSE
      QUESTIONS INVOLVING UNMATCHED CANDIDATE NUMBERS IN THE
      (NAME #) EXPRESSION.

           IN THE CANDIDATE LIST, EACH CANDIDATE OR INCUMBENT IS
      ASSIGNED A NUMBER OR CODE.  NUMBERS BEGINNING WITH 1 (11-19)
      ARE FOR THE SENATE, NUMBERS BEGINNING WITH 3 (31-39) ARE FOR
      THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND NUMBERS BEGINNING WITH 5
      (51-58) ARE FOR GOVERNORS.  IN ADDITION, THE CODE OR NUMBER
      ASSIGNED TO A NAME HAS AN INTRINSIC MEANING--IT DENOTES THE
      FUNCTIONAL ROLE OF THAT PERSON IN THE CONTEXT OF THE 1982
      GENERAL ELECTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, CANDIDATE NUMBER 33 IS USED
      FOR A DEMOCRATIC HOUSE INCUMBENT SEEKING RE-ELECTION AND
      PLAYING, THEREFORE, THE DUAL ROLE OF HOUSE INCUMBENT AND
      DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN THE
      1982 ELECTIONS.  THE PRECISE MEANING OF EACH CANDIDATE
      NUMBER USED IN THE STUDY IS GIVEN IN NOTE 4 OF THE NOTES
      SECTION.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, YOU WILL NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE
      SCHEME THAT WAS USED IN ORDER TO WORK EFFECTIVELY WITH THE
      QUESTIONS INVOLVING (NAME #) EXPRESSIONS.

           VIRTUALLY ALL STATES REDEFINED CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT
      BOUNDARIES (REDISTRICTED) DURING 1981 OR 1982 IN ACCORDANCE
      WITH NEW 1980 CENSUS POPULATION ESTIMATES.  IN THE CANDIDATE
      LIST, THE TERM 'INCUMBENT' DENOTES A HOUSE CANDIDATE WHO WAS
      A MEMBER OF CONGRESS PRIOR TO THE 1982 GENERAL ELECTIONS.
      UNLIKE 1978 AND 1980, THE INCUMBENT'S DISTRICT IN 1982 MAY
      CONSIST OF A FAIRLY DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREA FROM THE AREA
      COVERED BY THE DISTRICT PRIOR TO THE BOUNDARY CHANGES;
      THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH THE 'INCUMBENT' HOUSE CANDIDATE SERVED
      IN CONGRESS AS OF THE 1982 ELECTIONS, DEPENDING ON CHANGES
      IN DISTRICT BOUNDARIES, HE OR SHE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN
      THE SURVEY RESPONDENT'S DISTRICT INCUMBENT BEFORE 1982.
      BOTH THE 1982 AND THE 1978 CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT NUMBERS
      CORRESPONDING TO THE LOCATION OF INTERVIEW ARE REPORTED
      IN REF. NO. XXX AND REF. NO. XXX TO ENABLE RESEARCHERS TO
      INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE RESPONDENT'S INCUMBENT WAS
      CHANGED BY REDISTRICTING.


      SPECIAL INFORMATION: FEELING THERMOMETER (C5)

           EDWARD KENNEDY'S NAME IS REFERENCED TWICE IN THE
      FEELING THERMOMETER FOR RESPONDENTS IN MASSACHUSETTS.
      RESPONDENTS IN THIS STATE WERE ASKED TO RATE KENNEDY ONLY
      ONCE, AT THE FIRST LOCATION (C5C).  THE RESPONSE WAS THEN
      POST-EDITED INTO THE SECOND REFERENCE (C5E).


      SPECIAL INFORMATION:  LIBERAL, CONSERVATIVE, AND
      INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES

           THE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS LISTED BELOW HAD AN
      INDEPENDENT OR MINOR PARTY CANDIDATE RUNNING IN 1982, IN
      ADDITION TO A DEMOCRATIC AND/OR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE.

           THESE THIRD PARTY CANDIDATES WERE INCLUDED IN THE
      DESCRIPTION OF THE CONGRESSIONAL RACES.  THE TYPE OF HOUSE
      RACE (V10) WAS CODED 13, 19, 23, 29, 49, 56, 57 OR 59, AS
      APPROPRIATE.

           LIBERAL AND CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATES RUNNING IN NEW YORK
      HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN ALL NEW YORK DISTRICTS.  IN CASES
      WHERE THE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES ALSO HAD THE
      SUPPORT OF THE LIBERAL AND CONSERVATIVE PARTIES
      RESPECTIVELY, THEY ARE ASSIGNED THE CANDIDATE NUMBER

      TREATED THROUGHOUT THE QUESTIONNAIRE ONLY AS DEMOCRATIC OR
      REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES.


      SPECIAL INFORMATION: DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA INTERVIEWS

           SINCE THERE WERE NO RACES FOR THE U.S. SENATE OR THE
      U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,
      CERTAIN QUESTIONS IN THE INTERVIEW SCHEDULE WERE
      INAPPROPRIATE FOR RESPONDENTS LIVING IN THAT AREA.
      INTERVIEWERS IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WERE INSTRUCTED TO
      OMIT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE HOUSE, SENATE AND GUBERNATORIAL
      RACES.  THE LIST OF QUESTIONS OMITTED FOR DC RESPONDENTS
      INCLUDES:

           C2,C2A,C2B            J5E-J5G
           C4,C4A.C4B            J6E-J6G
           C5E-C5P               J7E-J7G
           E1-E44                K2,K2A,K10A
           F8,F8A                L4,L4A

           J3E-J3G               L8,L8A
           J4E-J4G

           SEVERAL CHECKPOINT QUESTIONS WERE ALSO INAPPROPRIATE
      FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA INTERVIEWS AND WERE CODED AS
      FOLLOWS:

           C3, E5, E8, F7, L5, L7 = 9
                              K10 = 2


      SPECIAL INFORMATION: VOTE QUESTIONS (SECTION L)

           ACCORDING TO LOUISIANA ELECTION LAWS ANY CANDIDATE
      RECEIVING OVER FIFTY PER CENT OF THE PRIMARY VOTE IS ELECTED
      TO OFFICE AND DOES NOT APPEAR ON THE BALLOT IN THE NOVEMBER
      GENERAL ELECTION.  IN BOTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS, 05 AND
      07, THE CANDIDATES WERE SO ELECTED.  THESE RACES WERE CODED
      14, IDENTIFYING THEM AS DISTRICTS WITH INCUMBENTS RUNNING
      UNOPPOSED (SEE Q.AA5).  THE CANDIDATE NUMBER ASSIGNED WAS 33
      - DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT (SEE SPECIAL INFORMATION ON (NAME #)
      EXPRESSIONS IN INTRODUCTION)


           THE VOTE SECTION, Q.L4-L8, WAS OMITTED FOR THESE
      DISTRICTS. RESPONDENTS WERE ASKED L1-L3 AND L9 SINCE THEY
      DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON OTHER STATE MATTERS IN
      NOVEMBER.  ALTERATIONS WERE ALSO MADE TO THE QUESTION
      WORDING IN C2 AND E1 (SEE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS FOR CHANGES).


      SPECIAL INFORMATION: GEORGIA 04 AND 05

           CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS 04 AND 05 IN GEORGIA WERE LATE
      IN FINALIZING A REDISTRICTING PLAN AND, AS A RESULT, THEIR
      CONGRESSIONAL PRIMARY WAS HELD NOVEMBER 2, FOLLOWED BY A
      SPECIAL HOUSE ELECTION HELD NOVEMBER 30. INTERVIEWING IN
      GEORGIA 04 AND 05 WAS DELAYED UNTIL DECEMBER 1, AFTER THE
      SPECIAL HOUSE ELECTION.  RESIDENTS OF THESE TWO GEORGIA
      DISTRICTS DID GO TO THE POLLS NOVEMBER 2 TO VOTE FOR ALL
      OTHER OFFICES AND ISSUES ON GEORGIA'S 1982 BALLOT.

           TO ASCERTAIN THE VOTING BEHAVIOR OF RESPONDENTS IN GA04
      AND 05, Q.L1 WAS ADMINISTERED, AND IF THE RESPONDENT
      REPORTED NOT VOTING NOVEMBER 2, HE/SHE WAS ASKED AN
      ADDITIONAL QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THEY VOTED IN THE SPECIAL
      NOVEMBER 30TH ELECTION.  (SEE L1 FOR QUESTION TEXT.) THIS
      ADDITIONAL QUESTION WAS NOT CODED SEPARATELY, BUT
      RESPONDENTS WHO REPORTED VOTING IN THE SPECIAL HOUSE
      ELECTION WERE RECODED TO A "1.  YES, DID VOTE" ANSWER IN L1.
      THUS, L1 CAPTURES RESPONDENT TURNOUT IN EITHER THE NOVEMBER
      2 OR THE NOVEMBER 30 ELECTION FOR GA04 AND GA05 RESPONDENTS.


      SPECIAL INFORMATION:  UNOPPOSED RACES

           IN THE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS LISTED BELOW, ONLY ONE
      MAJOR PARTY CANDIDATE RAN.  (SOME OF THESE DISTRICTS MAY
      HAVE HAD MINOR PARTY OPPOSITION).

             AL03         MA03         NY18
             CA25         MI01         OH03

             *LA05, LA07 (SEE "SPECIAL INFORMATION: VOTE QUESTIONS"
              IN INTRODUCTION)


      SPECIAL INFORMATION:  NJ13, IL01 AND NY08

           NJ13 AND IL01 WERE INCORRECTLY TREATED AS DISTRICTS
      IN WHICH THE INCUMBENT RAN UNOPPOSED BY A MAJOR PARTY
      CANDIDATE.  THREE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED IN EACH.
      SINCE THE TYPE OF HOUSE RACE WAS INCORRECTLY CODED AT THE
      TIME OF THE INTERVIEW, NO INFORMATION WAS OBTAINED ABOUT
      THE CONGRESSIONAL CHALLENGER.  THE OMITTED QUESTIONS WERE
      CODED AS MISSING DATA AND THE TYPE OF HOUSE RACE WAS
      CORRECTED.

           INFORMATION PUBLISHED BEFORE THE ELECTION INDICATED THAT
      FOR NY08 THE DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT'S OPPONENT WAS RUNNING AS
      AS A REPUBLICAN AND CONSERVATIVE.  THE TWO INTERVIEWS
      IN THIS DISTRICT WERE CONDUCTED ACCORDINGLY, AND
      RESPONDENTS WERE ASKED THE QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO THE
      REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE.  IN FACT, THE CHALLENGER RAN AS
      A CONSERVATIVE ONLY.  THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN
      CANDIDATE OR ABOUT THE INCUMBENT'S MAJOR PARTY OPPONENT,
      WHICH SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ASKED, HAVE BEEN CODED INAP., AND
      THE INFORMATION GATHERED ABOUT THIS CANDIDATE IN THE
      FEELING THERMOMETER SECTION, THE LIBERAL-CONSERVATIVE
      SCALE SECTION, AND THE ISSUE PLACEMENT SECTION HAS
      BEEN RECORDED IN THE VARIABLES PERTAINING TO THE
      INDEPENDENT/THIRD PARTY HOUSE CANDIDATE.  THE TYPE
      OF RACE VARIABLE HAS BEEN CORRECTED.






>> 1982 PROCESSING INFORMATION AND FILE STRUCTURE


           THIS STUDY WAS PROCESSED ACCORDING TO STANDARD ICPSR
      PROCEDURES FOR CLASS I STUDIES.  THE DATA WERE CHECKED FOR
      ILLEGAL AND INCONSISTENT CODES WHICH, WHENEVER FOUND, WERE
      CORRECTED BY REFERRING TO THE ORIGINAL INTERVIEW SCHEDULES.

           ALL FREQUENCIES APPEAR IN THE BODY OF THE CODEBOOK.

           NOTE NUMBERING IN THE APPENDIX IS NOT CONTIGUOUS, BUT
      ALL NOTES THAT ARE REFERENCED IN THE CODEBOOK ARE PRESENT IN
      THE NOTES SECTION.





>> 1982 CODEBOOK INFORMATION

The following example from the 1948 NES study provides the standard 
format for codebook variable documentation. 

Note that NES studies which are not part of the Time-Series usually
omit marginals and the descriptive content in lines 2-5 (except for
variable name).

Line 2 - VARIABLE NAME.  Note that in the codebook the variable name
         (usually a 'number') does not include the "V" prefix which is 
         used in the release SAS and SPSS data definition files
         (.sas and .sps files) for all variables including those
         which do not have 'number' names.  For example the variable
         "VERSION" in the codebook is "VVERSION" in the data definition
         files.

Line 2 - "NAME".  This is the variable label used in the SAS and SPSS
         data definition files (.sas and .sps files).  Some codebooks 
         exclude this.

Line 3 - COLUMNS.  Columns in the ASCII data file (.dat file).

Line 4 - CHARACTER OR NUMERIC.  If numeric and the variable is a decimal
         rather than integer variable, the numer of decimal places is 
         also indicated (e.g. "NUMERIC  DEC 4")

Line 5 - Values which are assigned to missing by default in the Study's
         SAS and and SPSS data definition files (.sas and .sps files).

Line 7 - Actual question text for survey variables or a description of 
         non-survey variables (for example, congressional district).
         Survey items usually include the question number (for example
         "B1a.") from the Study questionnaire; beginning in 1996 
         non-survey items also have unique item numbers (for example
         "CSheet.1").

Line 9 - A dashed or dotted line usually separates question text from
         any other documentation which follows.

Line 10- When present, annotation provided by Study staff is presented
         below the question text/description and preceding code values.

Lines 11-16
         Code values are listed with descriptive labels.  Valid codes
         (those not having 'missing' status in line 5) are presented
         first, followed by the values described in line 5.  For
         continuous variables, one line may appear providing the range
         of possible values.  A blank line usually separates the 'valid'
         and 'missing' values.

Lines 11-16
         Marginals are usually provided for discrete variables.  The
         counts may be unweighted or weighted; check the Study codebook
         introductory text to determine weight usage.
