>> 1980 CENSUS DEFINITIONS                         
                                                                               
             This note contains definitions of terms used by the 1980
             U.S. Census of Population.
                                                                               
                  STANDARD METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS (SMSA's):
                                                                               
             The general concept of a metropolitan area is one of a large
             population nucleus, together with adjacent communities that
             have a high degree of economic and social integration with
             that nucleus.
                                                                               
             Each SMSA has one or more central counties containing the
             area's main population concentration: an urbanized area with
             at least 50,000 inhabitants.  An SMSA may also include
             outlying counties that have close economic and social
             relationships with the central counties.  The outlying
             counties must have a specified level of commuting to the
             central counties and must also meet certain standards
             regarding metropolitan character, such as population
             density, urban population and population growth.  In New
             England, SMSA's are composed of cities and towns rather than
             whole counties.
                                                                               
             The population living in SMSA's may also be referred to as
             the metropolitan population.  The population is subdivided
             into "inside central city (or cities)" and "outside central
             city (or cities)."  (The population living outside SMSA's
             constitutes the non-metropolitan population.)  Most SMSA's
             have one to three CENTRAL CITIES that are named in the
             census title of the SMSA.

                                                                               
                  STANDARD CONSOLIDATED STATISTICAL AREAS (SCSA's):
                                                                               
             In some parts of the country, metropolitan development has
             progressed to the point that adjoining SMSA's are themselves
             socially and economically interrelated.  These areas are
             designated standard consolidated statistical areas (SCSA's)
             by the Office of Management and Budget, and are defined
             using standards included as part of the new SMSA standards
             described above.
                                                                               
                        DEFINITIONS OF THE SIX LARGEST SCSA's:

             (SOURCE:  Table 2 of 1980 CENSUS OF POPULATION PC80-S1-5,
             STANDARD METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS AND STANDARD
             CONSOLIDATED STATISTICAL AREAS:  1980.)
                                                                               
             For the purpose of size and distance coding of suburbs and
             non-SMSA's, the CENTRAL CITIES of the five largest SCSA's
             are listed as: New York (Manhattan), Los Angeles, Chicago,
             Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Detroit.
                                                                               
             URBANIZED AREAS: The major objective of the Census Bureau in
             delineating urbanized areas is to provide a better
             separation of urban and rural population in the vicinity of
             large cities.  An urbanized area consists of a central city
             or cities, and surrounding closely settled territory ("urban
             fringe").
                                                                               
             PLACES (In these materials called CENSUS PLACES):  Two types
             of places are recognized in the census reports--
                                                                               

             incorporated places and unincorporated places, defined as
             follows:
                                                                               
             INCORPORATED PLACES--These are political units incorporated
             as cities, boroughs, towns and villages with the following
             exceptions: (a) boroughs in Alaska; and (b) towns in New
             York, Wisconsin and the New England states.
                                                                               
             UNINCORPORATED PLACES--The Census Bureau has delineated
             boundaries for closely settled population centers without
             corporate limits.  Each place so delineated possesses a
             definite nucleus of residences and has its boundaries drawn
             to include, if feasible, all the surrounding closely settled
             area.
                                                                               
                                                                               



>> 1990 CENSUS DEFINITIONS                         

                                                                               
             THIS NOTE CONTAINS DEFINITIONS OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS
             USED BY THE 1990 U.S. CENSUS OF POPULATION:
                                                                               
                  Metropolitan Statistical Areas
                  Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas
                  Urbanized Areas
                  Places
                  Incorporated Places
                  Unincorporated Places

                                                                               
             1. "METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS (MSA's):"
                                                                               
             The general concept of a metropolitan area is one of a large
             population nucleus, together with adjacent communities that
             have a high degree of economic and social integration with
             that nucleus.
                                                                               
             In 1990 the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and
             the U.S. Census have used the term Metropolitan Statistical
             Area (MSA) for what in 1980 was referred to as Standard
             Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA).  An attempt has been
             made by the study staff to be consistent in using the newer
             terms in the current documentation and definitions.  The
             definitions of characteristics to be classified as a
             metropolitan area have remained fairly consistent--with only
             minor changes between 1980 and 1990.  However, due to
             changes in population size and density, employment,
             commuting and other behavior which defines metropolitan
             areas, the specific geographical composition of any given
             metropolitan area has, of course, frequently changed.  The
             specific MSA title may also have changed as to which cities
             are named and in what order.
                                                                               
             Each MSA has one or more central counties containing the
             area's main population concentration: an urganized area with
             at least 50,000 inhabitants.  An MSA may also include
             outlying counties that have close economic and social
             relationships with the central counties.  The outlying
             counties must have a specified level of commuting to the
             central counties and must also meet certain standards
             regarding metropolitan character, such as population
             density, urban population and population growth.  In New
             England, MSA's are composed of cities and towns rather than
             whole counties.
                                                                               
                                                                               
             The population living in MSA's may also be referred to as
             the metropolitan population.  The population is subdivided
             into "inside central city (or cities)" and "outside central
             city (or cities)."  (The population living outside MSA's
             constitutes the non-metropolitan population.)  Most MSA's
             have one to three CENTRAL CITIES that are named in the
             census title of the MSA.

                                                                               
             2. "CONSOLIDATED METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS (CMSA's):"
                                                                               
             In some parts of the country, metropolitan development has
             progressed to the point that adjoining MSA's are themselves
             socially and economically interrelated.  These areas are
             designated consolidated metropolitan statistical areas
             (CMSA's) by the Office of Management and Budget, and are
             defined using standards included as part of the new MSA
             standards described above.  MSA's that are a part of a CMSA
             are referred to as primary metropolitan statistical areas
             (PMSA's).

             Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC (Jun 1990)
             (PB90-214420)

             The major objective of the Census Bureau in delineating
             urbanized areas is to provide a better separation of urban
             and rural population in the vicinity of large cities.  An
             urbanized area consists of a central city or cities, and
             surrounding closely settled territory ("urban fringe").

                                                                               
                                                                               
             4. "PLACES:"
                                                                               
             Two types of places are recognized in the census
             reports--incorporated places and unincorporated places,
             defined as follows:

                                                                               
             5. "INCORPORATED PLACES:"
                                                                               
             These are political units incorporated as cities, borought,
             towns and villages with the following exceptions: (a)
             boroughs in Alaska; and (b) towns in New York, Wisconsin and
             the New England states.

                                                                               
             6. "UNINCORPORATED PLACES:"
                                                                               
             The Census Bureau has delineated boundaries for closely
             settled population centers without corporate limits.  Each
             place so delineated possesses a definite nucleus of
             residences and has its boundaries drawn to include, if
             feasible, all the surrounding closely settled area.  These
             are called Census Designated Places (CDP's).

               "POVERTY" has the general thrust of helping the

>> 1988/1992 RELIGIOUS PREFERENCE MASTER CODES

                                                                               
             By 1988 NES had become aware that the evolution of the
             American religious scene had made the Religion Code in use
             at the time inadequate.  Two main criticism were leveled
             against it: 1) there weren't separate codes for some of the
             fastest growing denominations in the last twenty years and
             2) groups with different characteristics along political
             dimensions were lumped under the same heading.  A group of
             scholars headed by David Leege from the University of Notre
             Dame developed and then tested (in the 1989 NES Pilot) an
             entirely new coding scheme.  The new code was adopted in
             1990.  The table below is designed to help analysts doing
             comparisons across years.  However, it is precisely the
             nature of the problems that the new code was designed to
             address what makes any translation between the two codes
             extremely dubious.  For a complete discussion of the
             development of the 1990 Code please see: Leege, D,, Wald, K.

             Codes 800 and 801 exist in the revised set of religion
             summary codes, however, because of the change which took
             place in 1990 within the sequencing of questions, since 1990
             Rs who may be SPECIFICALLY atheists or agnostics have been
             filtered out very early in the series; since they respond
            'no' both to church attendance and to consideration of self
             as part of a church or denomination, they are INAP from
             questions which assign specific categories of religious
             self-identification and are therefore to be found within the
             'no religious preference' (INAP) cases in code 0.
                                                                               
                                                                               





>> 1980 CENSUS OCCUPATION CODE

                                                                               
             The full 3-digit 1980 Census Occupation Code was used to
             code the occupation of respondents.  In order to minimize
             the amount of highly specific information released about
             respondents, the full occupation code has been recoded to a
             71 category code, which is based on the occupation code
             sub-headings in the Census Code.
                                                                               
             Users who need access to the full 3-digit occupation code
             for their research purposes should contact NES project staff
             for details about how this could be arranged.
                                                                               
             In the code description that follows, the full 1980 Census
             Code is presented.  At the beginning of each recoded
             section, the statement "(XXX) THROUGH (YYY) ARE RECODED TO
             (ZZ)" indicates the code values to which the specific
             occupations have been recoded.  For example, purchasing
             managers (009), legislators (003), and funeral directors
             (018) have all been recoded to (01).  Numbers in parentheses
             following the occupation categories are the U.S. Department
             of Commerce's 1980 Standard Occupational Classification code
             equivalents.  The abbreviation "pt" means "part" and
             "N.E.C." means "not elsewhere classified".

>> ICPSR OCCUPATION RECODES, 1992


             The occupation coding in 1990 follows the pattern started in
             1986, thus differing from earlier election studies.  First,
             only the 1980 occupation and industry codes are provided.
             Second, the occupation coding has been released in less
             detail than in years past.  The dataset includes only
             two-digit codes for occupational category where in the past
             the three-digit Census Bureau codes were provided.  The
             two-digit codes represent a total of 71 occupational
             categories derived from the Census Bureau major occupational
             group headings.  Those who have need of the full occupation
             code for their research should contact the NES project staff
             for information about the conditions under which access to
             these data may be provided.

             A detailed series of questions relating to occupation and
             work was asked of the respondent (Q.Y4-Y20a).  If the
             respondent was female and married/partnered, a parallel
             series of items was asked about her husband/partner's
             occupation and work (Q.Y22-Y37a).  If the respondent was
             male and married/partnered, only one summary item regarding
             his wife/partner's work status was obtained (Q.Y3h).  This
             corresponds with the 1988 survey, but differs from earlier
             studies where full spouse/partner information was collected
             for both males and females, and 1986, where only one item on
             spouse/partner work status was asked.

             There are two recoded series of variables concerning
             occupation and work-- the ICPSR "stacked" variables for
             respondent and married/partnered female respondent's
             husband/partner.  In the occupation section, respondents are
             first asked a lead-in question about their current work
             status (e.g., employed, temporarily laid off, unemployed,
             retired, permanently disabled, homemaker, student). Then,
             the respondent is asked occupation and work questions
             relevant to his/her current work status.  For example, if
             the respondent was unemployed, he/she would be asked the
             questions from the unemployed/retired/permanently disabled
             section concerning the respondent's last regular job.
             Although the questions dependent upon work status differ
             slightly, most of the items asked are parallel, with
             slightly different wording to reflect the work-status
             category. It has been ICPSR practice to "stack" responses to
             parallel series of questions into variables that include
             information about work and occupation for all respondents
             across all work status categories.  The only exception to
             this are those respondents who are homemakers and/or

             students without outside employment.  These cases are coded
             INAP throughout the stacked variable series.  The occupation
             series for "R's husband/partner" is stacked in the same
             fashion. Please remember, however, that this series was
             asked ONLY where the respondent was female and
             married/partnered.

             The ICPSR release of the 1990 Post Election file includes
             both the original occupation/work items and the stacked
             versions of these variables.  Respondent unstacked items can
             be found in V565-601.  Stacked respondent items are in
             V602-611.  Unstacked "husband/partner" items are in V613-649
             and stacked "husband/partner" items are in V650-659.

             In contrast to previous election studies, but like the 1988
             Pre/Post Survey, the 1990 survey did not collect information
             regarding "head of family". Therefore, both original and
             recoded variables relating to the occupation and education
             of "head of family" that appeared in earlier election
             studies, do not appear in the 1990 file.

>> CITIES WITH POPULATION OF 25,000 AND OVER, 1992


             This list was developed from the 1973 WORLD ALMANAC AND BOOK
             OF FACTS, pp. 152-188 (1970 population figures).

               -  The first four digits are a unique code number for
                   each city.

               -  The fifth digit is the urbanicity code for each city,
                  as used in the 1971 Quality of Life study:

                     1 = City of over 1,000,000
                     2 = City of over 25,000 and up to 250,000 in an SMSA
                         of 1,000,000 or more[1]
                     3 = City of under 25,000 in an SMSA of 1,000,000 or
                         more
                     4 = City of over 250,000 and up to 1,000,000
                     5 = City of over 50,000 and up to 250,000 not in
                         SMSA of 1,000,000 or more
                     6 = City of 50,000 or less not in SMSA of 1,000,000
                         or more
                     9 = NA

             [1] The two 1970 STANDARD CONSOLIDATED AREAS (New
             York-Northeastern  New Jersey, and Chicago,
             Ill.-Northwestern Indiana), the remaining 1970 SMCA's of one
             millian or more, plus the Anaheim-Santa Ana-Garden Grove, CA
             SMSA (which was attached to the Los Angeles SMSA).

             Asterisk (*) indicates place added in 1982 (having
             population of 25,000+ in 1980 census) coded on basis of 1970
             status in area.  (See example Chandler, Arizona -- it's SMSA
             was not over one million in 1970, so coded 6 here.  This was
             done to avoid glaring inconsistencies in adjacent areas. The
             areas affected by this decision are the four places where
             the population of the SMSA topped the one million mark
             between 1970 and 1980 (Phoenix, Arizona; San Antonio, Texas;
             Ft. Lauderdale/Hollywood, Florida; Sacramento, California).

>> 1991 STUDY BACKGROUND DOCUMENTS



             February 25, 1991

             TO: Colleagues Interested in the National Election Studies

             FROM: Thomas Mann


             In response to the extraordinary events taking place in the
             Persian Gulf, the NES Board of Overseers has decided to
             expand the 1991 Pilot Study as the second leg on a larger,
             three wave study focusing on the electoral consequences of
             the war. The plan is to empanel every respondent to the 1990
             NES Post-Election Study, interviewing them in 1991, and
             again immediately following the 1992 presidential election.
             Additional funding from private foundations is being sought
             to support the expansion of the 1991 data gathering efforts
             and the 1992 wave of the panel study.  Although a
             substantial portion of the 1991 interview schedule will be
             dedicated to this purpose, interview time also will be
             devoted to piloting new survey questions. We are writing to
             inform you of these developments, to sketch out the
             substantive themes that will be the focus of the pilot work
             and that are likely to be central to the panel study, to
             describe the anticipated study design, and most importantly,
             to invite your suggestions and comments. Given our tight
             planning schedule, we need to hear from you within the next
             few weeks.


             SUBSTANTIVE THEMES FOR THE 1991 NES PILOT WORK

             In response to my letter of November 16, 1990, 45 scholars
             submitted 26 separate proposals for pilot work to the NES
             Board of Overseers.  The proposals focused on a very diverse
             set of topics, three of which the Board selected to be the
             central focus of the 1991 pilot effort: gender (gender
             equality, gender consciousness, and measures of opinion on
             gender-related policy disputes); ethnic politics (American
             and ethnic identity as well as opinion on immigration and
             language rights); and political participation (particularly
             the impact of social connectedness).  New questions on old
             age policy and knowledge of political institutions will also
             be piloted.

             SOME PROPOSED SUBSTANTIVE THEMES FOR THE
             1990-91-92 PANEL STUDY ON THE ELECTORAL CONSEQUENCES OF WAR

             Naturally one important element of the panel study will be a
             detailed investigation of the public's assessment of the war
             itself. When the dust from Desert Storm settles, and elites
             and media begin to sort things out and disagree, what does
             the American public think happened? What do citizens know
             about the war? What did it accomplish? At what price?  What
             are the lessons, as citizens make them out, of the Gulf War?
             In important respects, understanding the public's assessment
             of the war is a way station on the road to the more
             important objective of understanding how the war shapes the
             future course of national politics. The potential
             implications for public opinion radiate out in many
             directions. The war might well affect the strength of
             isolationist sentiment; the military's claim on the federal
             budget; views on dissent and protest; patriotism; the level
             of internal discord; the relative appeal of various
             Democratic challengers in 1992; confidence in government;
             alterations in national priorities; racial and ethnic
             conflict; and more.  These are important topics, and are
             included within the portfolio of study objectives. But two
             other themes might serve as the center of analytic
             attention.

             First is the risk run by George Bush. Will the war
             strengthen the Bush Presidency? The success of the Bush
             Presidency and Bush's chances for re-election in 1992 depend
             enormously on voters' interpretations of the events in the
             Gulf.

             The second major theme is change in partisanship. Will the
             war accelerate or reverse the drift towards a Republican
             majority? The partisan debate that preceded the war as well
             as the debate that might follow could alter perceptions of
             the two parties and thus tip the balance of strength between
             them, a result that would hold consequences for national
             politics well beyond the particular outcome in 1992.

             NES turns out be extraordinarily well-positioned to carry
             out this kind of study.  Although the leading edge of the
             conflict was visible in the fall of 1990, it did not make a
             real impression on the general public until after the 1990
             NES Post-Election Study had finished its business.  This
             means that the 1990 NES Post-Election Study provides
             excellent baseline data, providing as it does in-person
             interviews with a representative sample of 2,000 Americans
             taken before the war began to hit home.

             The second attraction of the 1990 NES is that it does in
             fact supply pre-war measurements of opinions that are
             essential to understanding the electoral consequences of the
             Persian Gulf War.  Most important for present purposes, the
             1990 NES interview included detailed measures of Americans'
             assessments of the Bush Presidency, their attachments to the
             political parties, their engagement in public affairs, their
             opinions on foreign policy and defense related issues, as
             well as their initial position on U.S. policy in the Persian
             Gulf. In short, the timing and content of the 1990 study
             puts NES in a uniquely strong position to carry out a study
             of the electoral consequences of the Persian Gulf War.

             We have so far pretended that the only thing going on these
             days is war, a drastic simplification.  President Bush also
             confronts problems on the domestic front: while at war in
             the Gulf, the national economy has slipped into recession,
             the federal budget continues to hemorrhage, and a great
             number of domestic needs go unaddressed. Moreover, these
             problems are intertwined. Although war is now crowding the
             domestic problems off the agenda, the media, members of
             Congress, and the general public are unlikely to remain
             quite so preoccupied for long.

             We need to know your reactions to these themes. What should
             the priorities be?


             STUDY DESIGN

             Cost considerations require that the 1991 and 1992 waves of
             the panel study be conducted by telephone. Turning to the
             telephone, however, produces a problem: ignoring the 14
             percent of the 1990 sample that is inaccessible by phone
             (either because the respondent doesn't have a phone, won't
             give us the number, or is unable to complete a telephone
             interview) would underrepresent the very young and the very
             old, non-whites, the less educated, the poor and the
             politically disengaged. To maintain the sample's integrity,
             we plan to conduct face-to-face interviews with those
             respondents who cannot be re-contacted by phone.

             We will do our best to keep panel attrition as low as
             possible (about 20 percent per wave).  (We have already
             begun to track our 1990 respondents to catch those who have
             moved since our November interview.) Also keep in mind that
             there will be a fresh national sample in 1992 as part of the
             usual presidential election year National Election Study
             that will provide analysts with the leverage needed to
             estimate panel effects due both to repeated interviews and
             sample attrition.

             If we are able to raise the additional funds needed to carry
             out this study, and if all goes well with its
             implementation, we anticipate conducting about 1,600
             reinterviews in 1991 and 1,280 reinterviews in 1992.

             The 1991 interview schedule will be partitioned to
             accommodate both questions on the electoral consequences of
             the war as well as the 1991 pilot work. We anticipate a
             40-45 minute questionnaire. Part I, will carry questions
             needed for the 1990-91-92 panel study and will run for about
             25-30 minutes.  Because the pilot work can be sustained on a
             fewer number of cases, Part II of the questionnaire will be
             divided into three random samples.  Each subsample will let
             a different form of the pilot questionnaire creating a total
             of 30-45 minutes of interview time for pilot work.
             (Administrative practicality mandates that the pilot
             questions be administered only to those respondents
             contacted by phone. We anticipate that each subsample will
             contain about 458 cases.)

             The fluid events in the Persian Gulf make it difficult to
             set the precise date on which to begin the 1991 field work.
             Our plan is to wait until the war is over, when its
             repercussions have begun to settle in a bit, when
             preferences are more likely to be considered and less likely
             to be bouncing around in response to the headlines of the
             day, when the post-war debate has begun -- in short a few
             months after the fighting is over. We suspect that
             interviewing will begin in early summer.  However, we would
             greatly appreciate your advice on the timing and the
             post-war interview.


             STUDY PLANNING COMMITTEES

             in the planning of the 1991 effort. Professor Mary Jackman
             will chair the committee responsible for setting the pilot
             content. Three members of the NES community -- Professors
             Jack Citrin, Steven Wack and Virginia Sapiro -- will join
             Professor Jackman and a subset of the NES Board in drafting
             the pilot portion of the 1991 interview schedule.

             A second committee, chaired by Professor David Leege, will
             design the portion of the 1991 questionnaire focusing on the
             electoral consequences of the war. The Board of Overseers
             has invited three scholars -- Professors Thomas W. Graham,
             Everett Carl Ladd, and John Mueller -- to join a subset of
             the Board in planning this component of the 1991 study.  We
             welcome your comments and suggestions about the substantive
             themes we have identified (as well as those we may have
             missed) for the 1990-91-92 panel study on the electoral
             consequences of the war. No doubt a portion of the '91
             interview schedule will re-ask questions that appeared on
             the '90 Post-Election Study. Suggestions about which
             specific items should be empaneled and what new questions
             might be added to the '91 wave would also be appreciated.
             Your suggestions should reach us by March 25 and should be
             mailed to:

                      (mideast) oil for energy; made us less willing to
