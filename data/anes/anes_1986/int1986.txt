>> 1986 INTRODUCTION AND STUDY DESCRIPTION

      THE NES/CPS AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY, 1986, WAS
      CONDUCTED BY THE CENTER FOR POLITICAL STUDIES OF THE
      INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH, UNDER THE GENERAL DIRECTION
      OF WARREN E.  MILLER.  SANTA TRAUGOTT IS THE DIRECTOR OF
      STUDIES.  THIS IS THE NINETEENTH IN A SERIES OF STUDIES OF
      AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTIONS PRODUCED BY THE POLITICAL
      BEHAVIOR PROGRAM OF THE SURVEY RESEARCH CENTER AND THE
      CENTER FOR POLITICAL STUDIES, AND IS THE FIFTH STUDY TO BE
      CONDUCTED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
      GRANTS (NOS. SOC77-08885 AND SES-8341310) PROVIDING
      LONG-TERM SUPPORT FOR THE NATIONAL ELECTION STUDIES.  SINCE
      1978, THE NES ELECTION STUDIES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED BY A
      NATIONAL BOARD OF OVERSEERS, THE MEMBERS OF WHICH MEET
      SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR TO PLAN CONTENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF
      THE MAJOR STUDY COMPONENTS.

      BOARD MEMBERS DURING THE 1986 PLANNING PHASE INCLUDED:
      RAYMOND E. WOLFINGER, CHAIR, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
      BERKELEY; MORRIS P. FIORINA, HARVARD UNIVERSITY; STEVEN J.
      ROSENSTONE, YALE UNIVERSITY; RICHARD A. BRODY, STANFORD
      UNIVERSITY; STANLEY FELDMAN, UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY; EDIE N.
      GOLDENBERG, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN; GARY C. JACOBSON,
      UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO; STANLEY KELLEY, JR.,
      PRINCETON UNIVERSITY; DONALD R. KINDER, UNIVERSITY OF
      MICHIGAN; WARREN E. MILLER, ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY, EX
      OFFICIO.

      THE 1986 STUDY PLANNING COMMITTEE INCLUDED SEVERAL BOARD
      MEMBERS (KELLEY, CHAIR; FELDMAN, FIORINA, JACOBSON, MILLER,
      EX OFFICIO; AND WOLFINGER) AND TWO OTHER SCHOLARS, DR.
      THOMAS MANN, AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION; AND
      JOHN ZALLER, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY.

      A PILOT STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN THE SUMMER OF 1985 FOR THE
      PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING NEW INSTRUMENTATION FOR THE 1986
      ELECTION STUDY. ITEMS APPEARING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1986
      WHICH WERE PRETESTED IN THE 1985 PILOT ARE ON RACIAL
      ATTITUDES, POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE, AND MORAL TOLERANCE.  DATA
      FROM THE PILOT STUDY ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE
      INTER-UNIVERSITY CONSORTIUM FOR POLITICAL AND SOCIAL
      RESEARCH (ICPSR #8476).  RESULTS FROM THE PILOT STUDY WERE
      USED BY THE PLANNING COMMITTEE IN FORMULATING
      RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD ABOUT STUDY CONTENT FOR THE
      1986 ELECTION STUDY. (SEE THE LIST OF 1985 PILOT
      STUDY REPORTS.)




>> 1986 SURVEY CONTENT AND ADMINISTRATION

      MUCH OF THE CONTENT OF THE OFF-YEAR POST-ELECTION SURVEYS IS
      CONSTRAINED BY THE REQUIREMENTS OF REPEATING "CORE"-- I.E.,
      THOSE ITEMS WHICH HAVE BEEN ASKED IN PREVIOUS ELECTION
      STUDIES AND WHICH THE BOARD OF OVERSEERS, ACTING FOR AND IN
      RESPONSE TO THE COMMUNITY OF NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY USERS,
      HAS DETERMINED TO BE CENTRAL TO THE NES PROGRAM OF RESEARCH.

      CORE ITEMS INCLUDE ATTENTION TO MEDIA, INTEREST IN THE
      CAMPAIGN, PARTY LIKES AND DISLIKES, RECALL OF AND LIKES AND
      DISLIKES OF CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES, CONTACT WITH INCUMBENT
      MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THOSE CHALLENGING THEM FOR ELECTION,
      FEELING THERMOMETERS FOR GROUPS AS WELL AS POLITICAL
      FIGURES, EVALUATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT, RESPONDENT'S OWN
      POSITION ON ISSUES AND RESPONDENT'S PLACEMENT OF THE
      PRESIDENT AND CANDIDATES ON THESE ISSUES,
      LIBERAL-CONSERVATIVE AND PARTISAN IDENTIFICATIONS,
      INFORMATION ABOUT REGISTRATION AND VOTING, AND AN EXTENSIVE
      ARRAY OF DEMOGRAPHIC MEASURES.

      "NEW" CONTENT IN 1986 REFLECTED SOME OF THE THEMES TESTED
      EXTENSIVELY IN THE 1985 PILOT STUDY-- VALUES (SEE THE MORAL
      TRADITIONALISM BATTERY, Q.P5A-P5H), POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE
      (Q.H2-H4) AND ATTITUDES ON RACIAL POLICY AS WELL AS MORE
      GENERAL ATTITUDES CONCEPTUALIZED AS ANTECEDENT TO THESE
      OPINIONS ON RACIAL QUESTIONS.  (FOR A LIST OF PAPERS
      PRESENTING PILOT COMMMITTEE ANALYSES OF THESE QUESTIONS,
      PLEASE REFER TO PG. XI, LIST OF REPORTS FROM THE ANES PILOT
      STUDY 1985.)

      BECAUSE THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN CONTENT WHICH
      ADDED UP TO SIGNIFICANTLY MORE MINUTES THAN IS PRESENTLY
      CONSIDERED TO BE THE LIMIT OF RESPONDENT "BURDEN" -- I.E.,
      75 MINUTES-- IT WAS DECIDED TO USE TWO FORMS IN
      ADMINISTERING THE 1986 NES.  FORMS A AND B DIFFER FROM EACH
      OTHER IN THAT FORM A CONTAINS UNIQUE MATERIAL FOR
      PRESIDENTIAL EVALUATION --TRAITS, AFFECTS, RETROSPECTIVE
      (AND PROSPECTIVE) ECONOMIC EVALUATIONS, WHILE THE QUESTIONS
      UNIQUE TO FORM B ARE BASICALLY ABOUT RACIAL ATTITUDES. ABOUT
      3/4 OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE IS COMMON MATERIAL, I.E., INCLUDED
      ON BOTH FORMS.  THE CODEBOOK INDICATES WHETHER A VARIABLE IS
      UNIQUE TO A FORM.




>>  1986 OCCUPATION CODING 

      IN THE 1986 ELECTION STUDY, THE OCCUPATION CODING IS BASED
      ON THE 1980 CENSUS BUREAU THREE DIGIT OCCUPATION CODE, AND
      HAS BEEN RELEASED IN SOMEWHAT LESS DETAIL THAN IN YEARS
      PAST.  THE DATASET INCLUDES A TWO-DIGIT CODE, WITH 71
      CATEGORIES CORRESPONDING TO CENSUS BUREAU OCCUPATIONAL
      GROUPINGS. THOSE WHO HAVE NEED OF THE FULL OCCUPATION CODE
      FOR THEIR RESEARCH SHOULD CONTACT THE NES PROJECT STAFF FOR
      INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH ACCESS TO THESE
      DATA MAY BE PROVIDED.

      CONFIDENTIALITY RECODING.

      FOR SOME YEARS, THE NATIONAL ELECTION STUDIES HAVE NOT
      RELEASED INFORMATION FOR CENSUS TRACTS OR MINOR CIVIL
      DIVISIONS. PERMISSION TO USE THE MORE DETAILED GEOGRAPHIC
      INFORMATION FOR SCHOLARLY RESEARCH PURPOSES MAY BE OBTAINED
      FROM THE BOARD OF OVERSEERS.  MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS IS
      AVAILABLE FROM THE NES PROJECT STAFF.

      OPEN-ENDED MATERIALS.

      TRADITIONALLY, THE ELECTION STUDIES HAVE CONTAINED SEVERAL
      MINUTES OF OPEN-ENDED RESPONSES (FOR EXAMPLE, THE PARTY
      LIKES AND DISLIKES QUESTIONS, B1-B4 IN THIS STUDY).  THESE
      QUESTIONS ARE CODED BY THE SRC CODING SECTION.  OTHER
      SCHOLARS HAVE DEVELOPED ALTERNATIVE OR SUPPLEMENTAL CODING
      SCHEMES FOR THESE QUESTIONS (FOR EXAMPLE, THE LEVELS OF
      CONCEPTUALIZATION, RELEASED AS ICPSR #8151).  THE BOARD OF
      OVERSEERS WISHES TO ENCOURAGE THESE EFFORTS BUT IN WAYS
      WHICH RESPECT THE NES AND SRC OBLIGATION TO PROTECT THE
      PRIVACY AND ANONYMITY OF RESPONDENTS.  CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER
      WHICH INDIVIDUALS MAY HAVE ACCESS IN ANN ARBOR TO THESE
      MATERIALS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT AND
      THOSE INTERESTED SHOULD CONTACT THE NES PROJECT STAFF FOR
      FURTHER DETAILS.

      USE OF PROBES.

      SRC INTERVIEWERS ARE INSTRUCTED TO PROBE AMBIGUOUS OR TERSE
      RESPONDENT ANSWERS WITH A LIMITED SET OF STANDARD PHRASES,
      AND TO RECORD USE OF THESE PROBES WHENEVER THEY OCCUR.  IN
      THIS YEAR'S STUDY, WE HAVE CODED THE USE OF PROBES IN
      SEVERAL PLACES IN THE QUESTIONNAIRE, PERHAPS MOST NOTABLY ON
      CANDIDATE PLACEMENTS FOR 7-POINT ISSUE SCALES.

      AUXILIARY INFORMATION.

      SAMPLING AND FIELD ADMINISTRATION VARIABLES ARE INCLUDED IN
      THIS RELEASE OF THE DATA.  FOR THE FIRST TIME, SOME
      INFORMATION ABOUT INTERVIEWERS HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE FILE,
      SUCH AS AGE, RACE, EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE.  (SEE VARIABLES
      V860037-V860040.)

      VALIDATED VOTE.

      AS IN 1978, 1980 AND 1984, NES DETERMINED WHETHER
      RESPONDENTS VOTED, BY REFERENCE TO REGISTRATION AND VOTING
      RECORDS IN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. ADDITIONAL ITEMS FOR 1986
      CONCERN THE OFFICE WHERE REGISTRATION/VOTE RECORDS WERE
      KEPT, INCLUDING THE TYPE AND ACCESSIBILITY OF THE VOTE/
      REGISTRATION RECORDS.

      OCCUPATIONAL PRESTIGE SCORES.

      DUE TO THE COLLAPSING OF CENSUS BUREAU OCCUPATION CODES,
      OCCUPATIONAL PRESTIGE SCORES ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN THE PUBLIC
      USE FILE. THOSE WHO HAVE NEED OF THE FULL OCCUPATION CODES
      AND RELATED PRESTIGE SCORES FOR THEIR RESEARCH SHOULD CONTACT
      THE NES PROJECT STAFF FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONDITIONS
      UNDER WHICH ACCESS TO THESE DATA MAY BE PROVIDED.

      FORMS.

      THE TWO FORMS, A-B, WERE COMBINED INTO ONE QUESTIONNAIRE,
      WITH ROUTING FOR FORM A AND B RESPONDENTS TAKING PLACE BY
      MEANS OF CHECKPOINTS.  (VARIABLES V860042 AND V960046 CONTAIN
      DATA ON FORM ADMINISTRATION).

      TO AVOID CLUSTERING OF RESPONDENTS BY FORM, SAMPLE
      ADDRESSES FOR EACH SEGMENT WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO FORM A
      AND FORM B.

      RESPONSE RATE AND FIELD PERIOD.

      THE RESPONSE RATE FOR THIS STUDY IS 67.7%.  THE STUDY WAS IN
      THE FIELD UNTIL JANUARY 31, ALTHOUGH 67% OF THE INTERVIEWS
      WERE TAKEN BY NOVEMBER 25, 80% BY DECEMBER 7, AND 93% BY
      DECEMBER 31. A STAFF TECHNICAL PAPER "RESPONSE EFFECTS IN
      THE 1986 ELECTION STUDY," IS BEING PRODUCED AND WILL BE
      AVAILABLE BY EARLY SUMMER. (SEE THE LIST OF WORKING PAPERS AND
      TECHNICAL REPORTS.)

      WRONG RESPONDENTS.

      FIVE RESPONDENTS WERE DETERMINED TO BE WRONGLY SELECTED. THE
      USUAL REASON FOR THE ERRONEOUS SELECTION IS THAT THE
      INTERVIEWER DID NOT FIND OUT UNTIL THE DEMOGRAPHIC SECTION
      ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF ANOTHER ADULT IN THE HOUSEHOLD.  THE
      INTERVIEW NUMBERS OF THESE RESPONDENTS ARE: 551, 847, 954,
      1992, AND 2176.

      CANDIDATE CARDS AND BALLOT LISTS.

      THE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF EACH SAMPLE AREA WAS
      DETERMINED BY THE SRC SAMPLING SECTION.  THE NES STUDY STAFF
      COMPILED INFORMATION FOR EACH SAMPLE POINT ABOUT CANDIDATES
      FOR GOVERNOR, SENATE AND THE CONGRESS.  USING CANDIDATE
      LISTS INCORPORATING THESE NAMES, INTERVIEWERS PRE-EDITED
      THEIR QUESTIONNAIRES SO THAT THE CORRECT CANDIDATE NAMES
      COULD BE READ TO RESPONDENTS AT VARIOUS POINTS IN THE
      QUESTIONNAIRE.  FOR THE VOTE CHOICE QUESTIONS (V860266,
      V860270, V860274) THE RESPONDENT USED A "BALLOT CARD" SHOWING
      THE CORRECT NAMES OF CANDIDATES FOR RACES IN THE RESPONDENTS
      DISTRICT.  THE CANDIDATE CARDS AND BALLOT LISTS ARE
      REPRODUCED IN THE APPENDIX SECTION OF THE CODEBOOK.

>> 1986 SAMPLING INFORMATION


      THE 1980 SAMPLING FRAME WAS DESIGNATED, SELECTED AND LISTED
      JOINTLY BY NORC AND SRC.  THE SAMPLE UNIVERSE INCLUDES ALL
      U.S. HOUSEHOLDS IN THE 48 COTERMINOUS STATES, ALASKA AND
      HAWAII.  (CIVILIAN HOUSEHOLDS RESIDING ON MILITARY BASES ARE
      NOT INCLUDED IN THE SAMPLE UNIVERSE AS DEFINED BY NES.)

      THE 1980 NORC/SRC NATIONAL SAMPLE IS A MULTI-STAGE AREA
      PROBABILITY DESIGN.  THAT IS, IN A SERIES OF HIERARCHICAL
      STEPS, GEOGRAPHICALLY DEFINED SAMPLING UNITS OF DECREASING
      SIZE ARE SELECTED WITH PROBABILITY PROPORTIONATE TO THEIR
      TOTAL OCCUPIED HOUSING UNIT COUNT.  THE OVERALL SAMPLING
      FRACTION IS 1:25,389.

      THE NATIONAL SAMPLE INCLUDES A FIRST STAGE SELECTION OF
      SMSA'S, COUNTIES AND COUNTY GROUPS (PRIMARY AREAS), A SECOND
      STAGE SELECTION OF AREA SEGMENTS (HOUSING UNIT CLUSTERS
      DEFINED BY CENSUS BLOCKS OR SUBSAMPLED PARTS OF SELECTED
      CENSUS ENUMERATION DISTRICTS), A THIRD STAGE SAMPLING OF
      (LISTED) HOUSING UNITS FROM THE SELECTED AREA SEGMENTS, AND,
      FOR THE NES SAMPLE, A FINAL STAGE OF RANDOMLY SELECTING A
      RESPONDENT FROM THE ELIGIBLE MEMBERS OF THE SAMPLE
      HOUSEHOLDS.

      IN THIS SAMPLE, PRIMARY AREAS CONSIST OF COUNTIES, SMSA'S,
      INDEPENDENT CITIES, AND IN NEW ENGLAND, PARTS OF COUNTIES.
      EIGHTY-FOUR PRIMARY AREAS WERE SELECTED AT THE FIRST STAGE.
      PRIOR TO SELECTION, PRIMARY AREAS WERE GROUPED INTO 84
      STRATA. THE STRATA WERE FORMED BY GROUPING METROPOLITANAND 
      NON-METROPOLITAN PAS WITHIN EACH OF THE FOUR CENSUS REGIONS.
      WITHIN EACH REGION, ADDITIONAL VARIABLES WERE USED TO DEFINE
      STRATA.  THE STRATIFYING VARIABLES INCLUDED WITHIN-REGION
      GEOGRAPHY AND SIZE; SIZE WAS MEASURED BY THE 1980 CENSUS
      COUNTY OF OCCUPIED HOUSING UNITS.  ONE PSU (PRIMARY
      SELECTION UNIT) WAS SELECTED FROM EACH STRATUM USING A
      CONTROLLED SELECTION PROCEDURE.

      SIXTEEN OF THE SELECTIONS ARE "SELF-REPRESENTING".  THAT IS,
      THERE IS ONE AND ONLY ONE SELECTION FROM THAT STRATA BECAUSE
      THE ENTIRE STRATA IS COMPRISED OF AN SMSA.  FOR EXAMPLE, NEW
      YORK AND CHICAGO SMSA'S ARE SELF-REPRESENTING.  TECHNICALLY,
      THESE ARE NOT PSUS SINCE THERE IS NO SELECTION AS SUCH
      INVOLVED. FOR THIS REASON THE 84 UNITS IN THE FIRST STAGE OF
      THE SAMPLE SELECTIONS ARE REFERRED TO IN SUBSEQUENT
      DESCRIPTIONS AS PRIMARY AREAS, RATHER THAN PSUS.

      FOR THE 1980 DESIGN, THE DESIGNATED SECOND STAGE SAMPLING
      UNITS (SSUS OR SEGMENTS) ARE COMPRISED OF CENSUS BLOCKS IN
      METROPOLITAN PRIMARY AREAS (OR ENUMERATION DISTRICTS IN SOME
      RURAL AREAS).  THIS REPRESENTS A CHANGE FOR SRC WHICH IN
      1970 USED AN INTERMEDIATE STEP OF SELECTING A STRATIFIED
      SAMPLE OF MINOR CIVIL DIVISIONS OR "PLACES" BEFORE SELECTING
      THE SMALLER BLOCK OR ED UNITS.

      SAMPLING OF SECOND STAGE UNITS WAS PERFORMED WITH
      PROBABILITIES PROPORTIONATE TO MEASURES OF SIZE (MOS) -- THE
      TOTAL OCCUPIED HOUSING COUNT FOR THE AREA.  BEFORE SECOND
      STAGE SELECTION TOOK PLACE, SSUS WERE ORDERED OR IMPLICITLY
      STRATIFIED USING A THREE STEP PROCEDURE.

      FIRST, IN MULTI-COUNTY PRIMARY AREAS, THE SSUS WERE ORDERED
      BY COUNTY ACCORDING TO GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND POPULATION
      SIZE OF THE COUNTY.  THIRTY-SIX OF THE EIGHTY-FOUR PRIMARY
      AREAS FELL IN STATES WHERE DATA WERE AVAILABLE FOR THE
      MEDIAN PER CAPITA INCOME FOR EACH MCD.  IN THESE AREAS, EACH
      MCD WAS CLASSIFIED INTO ONE OF THREE POPULATION SIZE, AND
      ONE OF THREE INCOME SIZE, CATEGORIES.  IN ALL PRIMARY AREAS,
      THE FINAL STRATIFICATION STEP WAS TO ORDER INDIVIDUAL CENSUS
      BLOCKS AND ENUMERATION DISTRICTS ACCORDING TO GEOGRAPHIC
      LOCATION.

      THE SECONDARY SELECTIONS (SEGMENTS) WERE MADE USING A
      SYSTEMATIC SELECTION PROCEDURE.  WITHIN THE 6 LARGEST
      PRIMARY AREAS, A VARYING NUMBER OF SEGMENTS CAN BE SELECTED,
      FROM 6 TO ABOUT 25.  IN ALL OTHER PRIMARY AREAS, SIX
      SECONDARY SELECTIONS WERE MADE.

      THE MINIMUM SIZE OF A SEGMENT IS 50 OCCUPIED HOUSEHOLDS, BUT
      THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF HOUSING UNIT LISTINGS IN A SEGMENT IS
      ABOUT 92.  IN ORDER TO MAKE MANAGEABLE THE SUBSEQUENT STEP
      OF LISTING THE HOUSING UNITS FROM WHICH SAMPLE SELECTIONS
      ARE TO BE MADE, THE SRC SAMPLE DESIGN FURTHER DIVIDES THE
      SEGMENTS INTO SEGMENT PARTS, WHICH ARE IDENTIFIABLE UNITS
      WITHIN THE SEGMENT WITH A MEASURE OF SIZE OF APPROXIMATELY
      16 TO 20 HUS -- FOR EXAMPLE, A CITY BLOCK.

      EACH HU IN AN ACTIVE SEGMENT PART IS THEN LISTED AS A SAMPLE
      "LINE," AND FINAL HOUSEHOLD SELECTIONS ARE MADE WITH A
      RANDOM START AND A SYSTEMATIC SAMPLING PROCEDURE.

      ONCE A HOUSEHOLD IS SELECTED, ALL PERSONS RESIDING THERE ARE
      LISTED BY THE INTERVIEWER, AND A RESPONDENT IS CHOSEN, USING
      A SELECTION TABLE FROM THE POLITICALLY ELIGIBLE ADULTS IN
      THE HOUSEHOLD.  (SEE VARIABLES V86007 AND V860014.)

      EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN THE UNITED STATES HAS AN EQUAL
      PROBABILITY OF FALLING INTO THE SAMPLE.  HOWEVER, ALL
      RESPONDENTS ARE NOT SELECTED WITH EQUAL PROBABILITY.  FOR
      EXAMPLE, ONCE A HOUSEHOLD IS SELECTED, AN ELIGIBLE
      INDIVIDUAL IN A HOUSEHOLD WITH THREE ELIGIBLE PERSONS HAS
      ONLY ONE-THIRD THE PROBABILITY OF SELECTION AS THE PERSON
      WHO IS THE ONLY ELIGIBLE PERSON IN HIS/HER HOUSEHOLD.
      TECHNICALLY, RESPONDENTS OUGHT TO BE WEIGHTED IN ALL
      ANALYSES BY THE INVERSE OF THEIR SELECTION PROBABILITY.  NES
      STAFF HAS TRADITIONALLY COMPARED FREQUENCIES RUN WEIGHTED
      AND UNWEIGHTED ON VARIABLES OF INTEREST AND CONCLUDED THAT
      THE DIFFERENCES IN DISTRIBUTIONS (TYPICALLY VERY MINOR) DO
      NOT JUSTIFY THE ADDED COMPLEXITIES OF WEIGHTING.  THIS IS
      THE CASE FOR 1986 AS WELL.

      FINALLY, THE FULL 1980 NATIONAL SAMPLE HAS 84 PRIMARY
      SELECTIONS, ONE FROM EACH STRATA.  IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FOR
      FLEXIBILITY IN SAMPLE DESIGN AND FOR EFFICIENCY IN STAFFING
      PRIMARY AREAS, THE SAMPLE DESIGN ALLOWS FOR USE OF 1/2, 2/3,
      5/6 OR ALL OF THE NONSELF-REPRESENTING PRIMARY AREAS.  THIS
      FEATURE ALLOWS A SMALLER NUMBER OF PRIMARY AREAS TO BE USED
      FOR SMALLER SAMPLE SIZES, ENABLING MORE OPTIMAL COST/
      STATISTICAL EFFICIENCY THAN WOULD RESULT IF THE SAMPLE WERE
      SPREAD ACROSS THE FULL 84 PRIMARY AREAS.

      IN PREVIOUS SRC SAMPLES, DESIRED INCREASES IN SAMPLE SIZE
      WERE HANDLED BY GENERATING ADDITIONAL LINES WITHIN A
      STANDARD SET OF SEGMENTS.  IN THE CURRENT SAMPLING FRAME,
      ADDITIONAL PRIMARY AREAS AND/OR SEGMENTS WITHIN THE LARGEST
      PRIMARY AREAS ARE SELECTED TO INCREASE SAMPLE SIZE.

      IN 1986 THE NES USED THE 2/3 SAMPLE OPTION, WHICH MEANS THAT
      ALL OF THE 16 SELF-REPRESENTING PRIMARY AREAS AND 45 (2/3 OF
      68) OF THE NON-SELF-REPRESENTING PRIMARY AREAS WERE USED,
      FOR A TOTAL OF 61 PRIMARY AREAS.  IN ADDITION TO FLEXIBILITY
      IN THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY AREAS WHICH MAY BE USED IN A
      SAMPLE, THE SRC SAMPLE DESIGN ALSO ALLOWS FOR FLEXIBILITY IN
      THE NUMBER OF SEGMENTS USED WITHIN SELF-REPRESENTING PRIMARY
      AREAS WHERE THE NUMBER OF SEGMENTS RANGES FROM 6 TO 25 IS
      PROPORTIONATE TO THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS IN THE PRIMARY
      AREAS.  THE NUMBER OF SEGMENTS IN EACH OF THE
      NON-SELF-REPRESENTING PRIMARY ARES IS EXACTLY 6.  THERE ARE
      426 SEGMENTS IN THE SAMPLE (OF WHICH 416 YIELDED AT LEAST
      ONE INTERVIEW); 156 FROM SELF-REPRESENTING AREAS AND 270
      FROM THE REMAINING ONE.  WITH 2176 INTERVIEWS, THERE ARE 5.1
      INTERVIEWS ON AVERAGE PER SEGMENT.

      THE SAMPLE IS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN THE APPENDIX ENTITLED
      "TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM ON THE SAMPLING DESIGN OF THE 1986
      NATIONAL POST-ELECTION STUDY".

>> 1986 DESCRIPTION OF VOTE VALIDATION OFFICE ADMINISTRATION VARIABLES

     The Election Administration dataset is part of the 1987 Vote Validation
Study. In order to better understand the results of the individual voter
record search, an interview was conducted with the Election Administration
official in charge of the election office pertaining to our sample. This
interview used a structured questionnaire which was designed to gather
information in three areas: 1) How registration and voting records were kept
and updated; 2) levels of office staffing and consequent ease of registration
and 3) interviewer evaluation of office organization, efficiency and
cooperation.

     Interviews were obtained with officials in 166 offices. Offices varied
greatly in size, record keeping procedures, level of computerization, and in
the ease with which access was given to our interviewer. The number of
registration records in a given office ranged all the way from Los Angeles
with 2 million records to a township in Michigan with 800. Almost 80% of the
offices are fully, partially or in the process of being computerized. Voting
records were unavailable in offices coded 68 and 76 and 79 on variable 882502
(Sample Address Office ID); they had being packed and stored (in office 68) or
burned (in office 76), or sent to the Secretary of State's office for
processing (office 79).

     For the most part office officials and supporting personnel were very
cooperative and gave our interviewers wide access to their records. In a few
instances they claimed only a state resident could have such access or the
interviewer was barred from seeing the actual record, since it contained
confidential information, i.e., birth date.

     The section of the questionnaire dealing with registration opportunities
(office hours and staffing) while accurate as far as it goes, is probably
inadequate to portray the variety of staffing and scheduling strategies
encountered. This portion of the questionnaire is to be extensively revised in
1988.

     The original election administration dataset of 166 records was expanded
so that information from the appropriate election office can be attached to
the record of each of the 2176 respondents in the 1986 Post election study.
The individual respondent case ID was added to the election administration
dataset, after expansion, to facilitate merging of the Election Administration
interview information with the 1986 post election survey file. Assuming that
both files are in 1986 election survey case ID sort order, the two files can
be easily merged. (Users may also request the original file of 166 records.)

     Users should be aware of the following special situations. Fifty one
respondents gave us in 1986 an address different than their sample address for
their registration address. We attempted to validate these people at the
office appropriate for the address where they told us they were registered.
Information about this situation is coded in variable 882042, Validation
Office ID, and variable 882043, Relation of Sample Address Office to
Validation Office. The office information for these 51 respondents which is
attached to their case ID in the expanded election administration file is the
one appropriate for the sample address, as recorded in variable 882502.

     Some respondents (N=15) in this category turned out to be registered at
nearby offices pertaining to sample segments which also happened to fall into
our sample. (They are coded 3 on variable 882043.) these cases, users might
desire to substitute for the election administration information in that
respondent's file (which, as noted above, pertains to the sample segment in
which the respondent actually lives, as opposed to that in which he/she is
registered) the election office data corresponding to his/her registration
information. Please contact NES Study Staff for information about how to do
this.

     A number of respondents in the 1986 election study were not validated
for any of several reasons; for example, they told us they were not registered
and did not vote; and/or they did not give us their name. In these cases,
office data was attached to respondents based on their sample address.


>> 1986 CODEBOOK INFORMATION


The following example from the 1948 NES study provides the standard 
format for codebook variable documentation. 

Note that NES studies which are not part of the Time-Series usually
omit marginals and the descriptive content in lines 2-5 (except for
variable name).

Line 2 - VARIABLE NAME.  Note that in the codebook the variable name
         (usually a 'number') does not include the "V" prefix which is 
         used in the release SAS and SPSS data definition files
         (.sas and .sps files) for all variables including those
         which do not have 'number' names.  For example the variable
         "VERSION" in the codebook is "VVERSION" in the data definition
         files.

Line 2 - "NAME".  This is the variable label used in the SAS and SPSS
         data definition files (.sas and .sps files).  Some codebooks 
         exclude this.

Line 3 - COLUMNS.  Columns in the ASCII data file (.dat file).

Line 4 - CHARACTER OR NUMERIC.  If numeric and the variable is a decimal
         rather than integer variable, the numer of decimal places is 
         also indicated (e.g. "NUMERIC  DEC 4")

Line 5 - Values which are assigned to missing by default in the Study's
         SAS and and SPSS data definition files (.sas and .sps files).

Line 7 - Actual question text for survey variables or a description of 
         non-survey variables (for example, congressional district).
         Survey items usually include the question number (for example
         "B1a.") from the Study questionnaire; beginning in 1996 
         non-survey items also have unique item numbers (for example
         "CSheet.1").

Line 9 - A dashed or dotted line usually separates question text from
         any other documentation which follows.

Line 10- When present, annotation provided by Study staff is presented
         below the question text/description and preceding code values.

Lines 11-16
         Code values are listed with descriptive labels.  Valid codes
         (those not having 'missing' status in line 5) are presented
         first, followed by the values described in line 5.  For
         continuous variables, one line may appear providing the range
         of possible values.  A blank line usually separates the 'valid'
         and 'missing' values.

Lines 11-16
         Marginals are usually provided for discrete variables.  The
         counts may be unweighted or weighted; check the Study codebook
         introductory text to determine weight usage.
