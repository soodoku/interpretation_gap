NOTE ON VARIABLE NAMING:                                                      
                                                                              
The variable name references used in NES Study codebooks do not include       
the "V" prefix found in all variable names used within the released           
SAS and SPSS data definition files (.sas and .sps files).                     
                                                                              
For example, "VAR 920001" and "VAR VERSION" in Study codebooks refer to       
V920001 and VVERSION in the study data definition files.                      
                                                                              
                                                                              
VARIABLE 'NUMBERING':                                                         
                                                                              
'Numbered' variables in NES timeseries datasets and in Pilot datasets         
(except the 1998 Pilot) comply with the following format:                     
                                                                              
     2-digit year prefix  +  4 digits  +  [opt] 1-char suffix.                
                                                                              
Examples:  1978 Post variable V780002; 1983 Pilot variable V832101.           
Note that for datasets including data from multiple studies, the 2-digit      
year prefix corresponds to the appropriate study year to which the            
variable is associated; for example, the 1983 Pilot dataset also includes     
1982 timeseries variables, for which the 2-digit prefix is 82.                
                                                                              
Non-time-series studies other than Pilots use 2-character mnemonic            
prefixes, for example variable VPS0048 in the 1988-1990-1992 Pooled           
Senate Study dataset.                                                         
                                                                              
                                                                              
SPECIAL NOTE ON COLUMN LOCATIONS:                                             
                                                                              
Some numeric variables use coding schemes that allow for code values          
having a varying number of digits. In such instances, the number              
of columns corresponding to the variable in the data file [.dat file]         
and in the column specifications  will be the width of the maximum value      
occurring in the actual data, rather than the maximum width allowable         
by the coding scheme.  For example, if codes 01-12 are allowed for a          
numeric variable but all values in the data are less than 10, then the        
number of columns corresponding to the variable within the ASCII data         
                                                                              
Note:  variable names in the SAS and SPSS data definition files have          
a "V" prefix, e.g. "V980003", "VICPSR98" etc. however in the codebook         
the "V" prefix is omitted (980003,ICPSR98).

        The Selection Table is used to select a respondent from               
        all household members who are eligible adults.  (An                   
        eligible adult is a U.S. citizen who is 18 years of age or            
        older by Election Day.)  The Selection Table appears on               
        the Coversheet below the Household Listing.                           
                                                                              
        After a complete listing of the HH is taken, each eligible            
        adult is assigned a "Number" based on the criteria of                 
        gender and age [beginning with the oldest male as number              
        1, males are numbered by increments of 1 according to                 
        descending age; females are numbered by descending age                
        starting with the number one higher than that assigned                
        to the youngest male].  The interviewer then uses the                 
        Selection Table to determine the "Number" of the eligible             
        adult to be interviewed.                                              
                                                                              
        The Selection Table itself consists of 2 parallel                     
        columns.  In the first column the interviewer circles the             
        total number  of eligible adults in the household; in the             
        second column (same row) is identified the Number" of the             
        person who will be the respondent.                                    
                                                                              
        There are 8 different Selection Tables used and they are              
        randomly assigned. [Note that although only 8 tables are              
        used, there are 12 codes in this variable because the 8               
        tables are used in cycles of 12; this procedure is used to            
        equalize the probability of selection for each eligible               
        adult].  A summary describing all 8 Selection Tables                  
        appears below.

        The HH composition code is derived from information                   
        provided in the household listing.  "Adults" are 18 years             
        of age (by election day) or older; all individuals                    
        included in the HH composition codes below refer to adults.           
                                                                              
        A designation of a HH member as "the householder" (HHR)               
        describes HU member who owns or rents the home (in whose              
        name the lease is held).  Cohabiting couples are coded as             
        married (30,40, 50-52).  Roommates of opposite sex are                
        coded 11,12,21,22; in all cases of unrelated roommates the            
        respondent is HHR.

        This question was intended to document cases where R                  
        offered resistance but gave no reason for resisting.                  
        In some cases, the interviewer misunderstood the question             
        as if it indicated whether or not R offered resistance.               
        During coding of coversheets, an attempt was made to                  
        recode this variable as 'unmarked' if 'marked were coded              
        but there were clear indications that the Respondent was              
        very eager or willing to be interviewed.  (Summary

        SPECIAL NOTE:  The race in AL07 had the Democratic incumbent          
        candidate incorrectly identified as a Republican incumbent            
        candidate.  For cases in this district, this variable should          
        be code 14 (not 24).  In addition, the race in CA41 was               
        identififed as type race 12 but should have been type race 55.        
        For cases in both of these districts, all 1998 study data remain      
        coded in accordance with the incorrect race type administered         
        (the candidate codes in V980068 and V980071 are also                  
        incorrect).

        incumbent (33) candidate incorrectly identified as an                 
        unopposed Republican incumbent candidate (34) so that this            
        variable was coded 34 but should have been 0.  In addition, the       
        Republican candidate in CA41 was incorrectly identififed as           
        candidate number 36 but should have been candidate number 32          
        (open race).                                                          
        For cases in both of these districts, all 1998 study data are         
        coded in accordance with the incorrect candidate code as              
        administered (the code for type of House race in V980065 is           
        also incorrect).                                                      
                                                                              
        Additional note:  cases in CA20 and FL22 had the correct              
        code for type of House race identififed (V980065) but an              
        incorrect candidate code number preloaded for the Republican          
        candidate.  In CA20, 34 was coded but should have been 36;            
        in FL22, 32 was coded in this variable but should have been           
        34. In both of these districts, the correct Democratic                
        candidate code was preloaded (V980068).

        Boston MSA but some from other New England MSAs -- some of            
        which could be outside of the Boston CMSA definition and              
        could be coded `2'.  It also means that in the Manchester-

        Coded according to the 1990 Census.  The major objective              
        of the Census Bureau in delineating urbanized areas is to             
        provide a better separation of urban and rural population             
        in the vicinity of large cities.  An urbanized area                   
        consists of a central city or cities, and surrounding                 
        closely settled territory ("urban fringe").  Size of Place            
        codes 21 and 41 include areas that are in the "urban                  
        fringe" but are not Census Places.                                    
                                                                              
        Note for Codes 50-53:  in a few cases, Non-MSA PSUs (based            
        on the 1980 OMB SMSA definitions) contain areas which are             
        now part of a 1990 PMSA or MSA (based on the June 1990 OMB            
        definition).  In these cases, the Size of Place Code for              
        any SSUs (segments) within such areas are coded in the                
        "40s" rather than in the "50s" as shown.  This occurred in

        The NECMA is the New England County Metropolitan Area code            
        as described in the 1990 SRC National Sample Design and               
        Development documentation.                                            
                                                                              
        In 1990 the U.S. Census adopted slightly different wording            
        and abbreviations for metropolitan areas, now known                   
        collectively as Metropolitan Areas (MAs).  What in 1980               
        were Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSAs)                  
        became in 1990 either Metropolitan Statistical Areas                  
        (MSAs) or Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas                      
        (PMSAs).   MSA is used for a metropolitan area which                  
        stands alone, i.e., is not a part of a Consolidated                   
        Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA).  PMSA is used for a             
        metropolitan area which is part of a larger CMSA.                     
                                                                              
        The metropolitan area standards for the 1990's generally              
        reflect a continuity with those adopted for the 1980's and            
        maintain the basic concepts originally developed in 1950.             
        The few substantive changes made between 1980 and 1990 are            
        detailed in the Federal Register, Vol. 55, No.62 cited in             
        the footnote.                                                         
                                                                              
        New England County Metropolitan Areas (NECMAs) provide an             
        alternative to the official city-and-town based                       
        metropolitan statistical areas in that Census region for              
        the convenience of data users who desire a county-defined             
        set of areas.  NECMAs have their separate definition                  
        standards detailed in the Federal Register (p. 12159).                
        Since the 1990 SRC National Sample primary stage of                   
        selection was based on the NECMA in New England, the 1990

        I'd like to get your feelings toward some of our                      
        political leaders and other people who are in the news                
        these days.  I'll read the name of a person and I'd like              
        you to rate that person using something we call the                   
        feeling thermometer.                                                  
        Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you              
        feel favorable and warm toward the person.  Ratings                   
        between 0 and 50 degrees mean that you don't feel                     
        favorable toward the person and that you don't care too               
        much for that person.  You would rate the person at the               
        50 degree mark if you don't feel particularly warm or                 
        cold toward the person.  If we come to a person whose                 
        name you don't recognize, you don't need to rate the                  
        person.  Just tell me and we'll move on to the next                   
        one.

        In talking to people about elections, we often find that              
        a lot of people were not able to vote because they                    
        weren't registered, they were sick, or they just didn't               
        have time.

        This variable documents whether the congressional                     
        district of vote was the same as congressional district               
        of R's residence at the time of interviewing.                         
                                                                              
        This variable is coded for all cases where R voted                    
        outside county of IW location and for some cases where                
        R voted within county of IW location.  Although exact                 
        voting location was not asked in 1998, in all cases where             
        respondent or interviewer comments indicated that district            
        of vote might not correspond to district of IW location,              
        an effort was made to determine the congressional district            
        where R actually voted.  Some voters who voted within                 
        county of residence nonetheless voted outside the

        Some Rs are registered in states other than that of their             
        residence.  If R is registered out of state, this variable            
        applies to the out-of-state race (if one occurred), not to            
        any Governor race in R's state of residence (if one

        a REPUBLICAN, a DEMOCRAT, an INDEPENDENT, or what?

        or a not very strong [Republican/Democrat]?                           
        Do you think of yourself as closer to the Republican

        Some people say that it is better for America if                      
        different racial and ethnic groups maintain their                     
        distinct cultures.  Others say that it is better                      
        if groups change so that they blend into the larger                   
        society as in the idea of a melting pot.  Which of

        Recently there has been a lot of talk about women's                   
        rights.  Some people feel that women should have an                   
        equal role with men in running business, industry, and                
        government.  (Suppose these people are at one end of a                
        scale, at point 1.)  Others feel that a woman's place is              
        in the home.  (Suppose these people are at the other                  
        end, at point 7.)  And, of course, some other people                  
        have opinions somewhere in between, at points 2,3,4,5 or

        Some people feel the government in Washington should see              
        to it that every person has a job and a good standard of              
        living (Suppose these people are at one end of a scale,               
        at point 1.)  Others think the government should just                 
        let each person get ahead on their own.  (Suppose these               
        people are at the other end, at point 7.)  And, of                    
        course, some other people have opinions somewhere in                  
        between, at points 2,3,4,5, or 6.

        Some people think the government should provide fewer                 
        services even in areas such as health and education in                
        order to reduce spending.  Suppose these people are at                
        one end of a scale, at point 1.  Other people feel it is              
        important for the government to provide many more                     
        services even if it means an increase in spending.                    
        Suppose these people are at the other end, at point 7.                
        And, of course, some other people have opinions                       
        somewhere in between, at points 2,3,4,5 or 6.

        Now, not looking at the booklet...                                    
        Some people say that because of past discrimination,                  
        blacks should be given preference in hiring and                       
        promotion.  Others say that such preference in hiring                 
        and promotion of blacks is wrong because it gives blacks              
        advantages they haven't earned.

        preferential hiring and promotion of blacks?

        Some people think we need much tougher government                     
        regulations on business in order to protect the                       
        environment.  (Suppose these people are at one end of a               
        scale, at point 1.)  Others think that current                        
        regulation to protect the environment are already too                 
        much of a burden on business.  (Suppose these people are              
        at the other end of the scale, a point number 7.)  And,               
        of course, some other people have opinions somewhere in               
        between at points 2,3,4,5 or 6.

        There has been some discussion about abortion during                  
        recent years.                                                         
        Which one of the opinions on this page best agrees with               
        your view?  You can just tell me the number of the                    
        opinion you choose.                                                   
                                                                              
        1. By law, abortion should never be permitted.                        
        2. The law should permit abortion ONLY in case of rape,               
           incest or when the woman's life is in danger.                      
        3. The law should permit abortion for reasons OTHER THAN              
           rape, incest or danger to the woman's life, but only               
           after the need for the abortion has been clearly                   
           established.                                                       
        4. By law, a woman should always been able to obtain an               
           abortion as a matter of personal choice

        Now I'm going to read several statements.  After each                 
        one, I would like you to tell me whether you agree                    
        strongly, agree somewhat, neither agree nor disagree,                 
        disagree somewhat, or disagree strongly with this                     
        statement.                                                            
        The first statement is:                                               
                                                                              
        Irish, Italians, Jewish and many other minorities                     
        overcame prejudice and worked their way up.  Blacks                   
        should do the same without any special favors.

        Occupation/employment variables represent 5 series of                 
        questions.  The question series initially assigned to R               
        (Y5) is determined by R's self-identification of                      
        employment status as found in Y5.  The series occupation              
        data are:

        Note: The final employment status summaries Y6-Y7 are                 
        built using both R's initial self-identification per Y5               
        and additional information provided by R during                       
        questioning.                                                          
                                                                              
        The retired who are also currently working have data in               
        both the RETIRED and WORKING NOW series; the disabled                 
        may also have data in both DISABLED and WORKING NOW                   
        series.  For homemaker and student Rs, the 1st question               
        in the HOMEMAKER/STUDENT series asks whether R is                     
        currently working; if so, R is immediately transferred                
        out of that series to the WORKING NOW series (the                     
        HOMEMAKER/STUDENT series not completed).                              
                                                                              
        Since many questions are asked across multiple series,                
        data for common questions across series are "stacked"                 
        into variables V98038-V98048; for these stacked                       
        variables the following data are included:

        This variable describes the series of employment questions            
        to which R is initially assigned according to R's self-               
        identification of employment status.                                  
                                                                              
        By contrast, the Y6 and Y7 employment status summary variables        
        are built using relevant information from R's Y5 self-                
        identification and also from information obtained during              
        questioning (especially number of hours worked).                      
                                                                              
        Initial series assignment from multiple mentions given                
        by R for his or her own employment status is as follows:

        Note that Rs initially assigned per Y5 to the RETIRED, DISABLED

        series to the WORKING NOW series if the R was also currently

        Rs who do not live with a family member age 14 or older               
        were not asked this question.  Their response to Y21 was              
        duplicated in this variable.                                          
        Note that in 53 cases, due to interviewer error in the Y19            
        checkpoint administration, the Y20 family income question             
        was not administered although R was not the only household            
        member aged 14 and older.  These cases have been coded NA;            
        their individual income data have not been duplicated here.           
                                                                              
        Additional note:  In 14 cases, interviewers entered                   
        responses where R's individual income (Y20a/Y21) was
