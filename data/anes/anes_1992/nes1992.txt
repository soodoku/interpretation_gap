NOTE ON VARIABLE NAMING:                                                      
                                                                              
The variable name references used in NES Study codebooks do not include       
the "V" prefix found in all variable names used within the released           
SAS and SPSS data definition files (.sas and .sps files).                     
                                                                              
For example, "VAR 920001" and "VAR VERSION" in Study codebooks refer to       
V920001 and VVERSION in the study data definition files.                      
                                                                              
                                                                              
VARIABLE 'NUMBERING':                                                         
                                                                              
'Numbered' variables in NES timeseries datasets and in Pilot datasets         
(except the 1998 Pilot) comply with the following format:                     
                                                                              
     2-digit year prefix  +  4 digits  +  [opt] 1-char suffix.                
                                                                              
Examples:  1978 Post variable V780002; 1983 Pilot variable V832101.           
Note that for datasets including data from multiple studies, the 2-digit      
year prefix corresponds to the appropriate study year to which the            
variable is associated; for example, the 1983 Pilot dataset also includes     
1982 timeseries variables, for which the 2-digit prefix is 82.                
                                                                              
Non-time-series studies other than Pilots use 2-character mnemonic            
prefixes, for example variable VPS0048 in the 1988-1990-1992 Pooled           
Senate Study dataset.                                                         
                                                                              
                                                                              
SPECIAL NOTE ON COLUMN LOCATIONS:

Some numeric variables use coding schemes that allow for code values
having a varying number of digits. In such instances, the number
of columns corresponding to the variable in the data file [.dat file] 
and in the column specifications  will be the width of the maximum value
occurring in the actual data, rather than the maximum width allowable
by the coding scheme.  For example, if codes 01-12 are allowed for a
numeric variable but all values in the data are less than 10, then the
number of columns corresponding to the variable within the ASCII data 
file will be 1.                                                                
                                                             


1992 variables appear following the 1990 and 1991 variables (enhanced data).

              The Selection Table is used to select a respondent from all     
              eligible adults (18 years of age or older by Election Day       
              and U.S. citizens) in a household.  A complete listing of       
              the household is taken and each eligible adult is assigned a    
              number based on the criteria of sex and age.  The               
              interviewer then uses the Selection Table to determine the      
              number of the eligible adults to be interviewed.  The           
              Selection Table consists of two parallel columns of numbers.    
              In the first column the interviewer circles the total number    
              of eligible adults in the household; in the second column       
              there is a number that identifies (i.e., matches the number     
              assigned to one of the eligible adults) the respondent.         
                                                                              
              There are eight different Selection Tables used and they are    
              randomly assigned.  The Selection Table appears on the          
              coversheet below the household listing.  (Although only         
              eight tables are used, there are 12 codes in this variable      
              because the eight tables are used in cycles of 12; this         
              procedure is used to equalize the probability of selection      
              for each eligible adult).

              In this interview I will be talking with you about the          
              recent elections, as well as a number of other things.          
              First, I have some questions about the political campaigns      
              that took place this election year.                             
                                                                              
              Q.A1.  Some people don't pay much attention to political        
              campaigns.  How about you?   Would you say that you were        
              VERY MUCH INTERESTED, SOMEWHAT INTERESTED, or NOT MUCH          
              INTERESTED in following the political campaigns this year?

              Q.B13.  (RB, P.5) I'd like to get your feelings toward some     
              of our political leaders and other people who have been in      
              the news.                                                       
                                                                              
              I'll read the name of a person and I'd like you to rate that    
              person using something called the feeling thermometer.  You     
              can choose any number between 0 and 100.  The higher the        
              number, the warmer or more favorable you feel toward that       
              person; the lower the number, the colder or less favorable.     
              You would rate the person at the 50 degree mark if you feel     
              neither warm nor cold toward them.  If we come to a person      
              whose name YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE, you don't need to rate that     
              person.  Just tell me and we'll move on to the next one. Our    
              first person is George Bush.                                    
                                                                              
              PROBE FOR "I DON'T KNOW" RESPONSE: When you say "don't know"    
              do you mean that you don't know who the person is, or do you    
              have something else in mind?

              Representatives can have contact with the people from their     
              districts.  On this page are some of these ways.  Think of      
              (NAME #33 or 34) who has been a U.S. Representative in          
              Washington.  Have you come into contact with or learned         
              anything about (him/her) through any of these ways?

              Q.D1.  In talking to people about elections, we often find      
              that a lot of people were not able to vote because they         
              weren't registered, they were sick, or they just didn't have    
              time. How about you--did you vote in the elections this         
              November?

              Q.F1.  Some people seem to follow what's going on in            
              government and public affairs most of the time, whether         
              there's an election going on or not.  Others aren't that        
              interested.  Would you say you follow what's going on in        
              government and public affairs MOST OF THE TIME, SOME OF THE     
              TIME, only NOW AND THEN, or HARDLY AT ALL?

              liberals and conservatives.  Here is a seven-point scale on     
              which the political views that people might hold are            
              arranged from extremely liberal to extremely conservative.

              haven't you thought much about this?

              Q.K4.  Some people feel that the economic sanctions against     
              South Africa should be decreased in light of changes in the     
              treatment of blacks that have taken place there recently.       
              Other people feel that sanctions should be increased in         
              order to pressure the government to make further changes.       
              And still others feel that the U.S. should continue to          
              impose about the same sanctions it imposes now.  What about     
              you?  Do you feel that sanctions against South Africa should    
              be DECREASED, should be INCREASED, should be KEPT ABOUT THE     
              SAME, or haven't you thought much about this?

              Q.K5.  (RB, P.11)  Recently there has been a lot of talk        
              about women's rights.  Some people feel that women should       
              have an equal role with men in running business, industry,      
              and government.  Suppose these people are at one end of a       
              scale, at point 1.  Others feel that a woman's place is in      
              the home.  Suppose these people are at the other end, at        
              point 7.  And, of course, some other people have opinions       
              somewhere in between at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

              Washington should see to it that every person has a job and     
              a good standard of living.  Others think the government         
              should just let each person get ahead on their own.

              Q.L4.  (RB, P.15)  Some people think the government should      
              provide fewer services, even in areas such as health and        
              education in order to reduce spending. Other people feel it     
              is important for the government to provide many more            
              services even if it means an increase in spending.

              should see to it that white and black children go to the        
              same schools.  Others claim that this is not the

              Q.R3.  (RB, P.21)  In past studies we have asked people why     
              they think white people seem to get more of the good things     
              in life in America--such as better jobs and more money--than    
              black people do.  These are some of the reasons given by        
              both blacks and whites.  Please tell me whether you agree or    
              disagree with each reason as to why white people seem to get    
              more of the good things in life.  (You can just give me the     
              number of your choice.)  The first statement is... PROBE AS

              Q.R3a.  Over the past few years, blacks have gotten less

              Q.R3c.  It's really a matter of some people not trying hard     
              enough; if blacks would only try harder they could be just      
              as well off as whites.

              the simplest case (Catholics) only one question was asked       
              (Q.X3a or Q.X3b).  In the most complex cases up to four         
              questions were asked.  For a complete layout of this series     
              please see section X of the questionnaire.                      
                                                                              
              The information gathered in Q.X3a/Q.X3b-Q.X8 was used to        
              build:

              NOTE: Q.Y4 and Q.Y22 need to be coded with a 2-digit code

              disabled/housewife/student who is also working now,             
              differentiated as to whether the employment is half-time or     
              more, or less than half-time.  To determine this you will       
              have to scan the entire employment section for R                
              (Q.Y4-Q.Y20a) to determine if R has information in more than    
              one employment category.  If so, you will then need to          
              determine the number of hours worked at the current job         
              (Q.Y6a) and assign R to the combination category e.g.,          
              working now and student) depending on whether they work 20      
              hrs+ or less.  This is done for all respondents.  If R is

              husband/your partner).  Is he working now, temporarily laid     
              off, or is he unemployed, retired, permanently disabled, (a     
              homemaker), (a student), or what? (MARK ALL THAT APPLY)

              NOTE: Q.Y4 and Q.Y22 need to be coded with a 2-digit code       
              that will allow us to classify a retired/permanently            
              disabled/housewife/student who is also working now,             
              differentiated as to whether the employment is half-time or     
              more, or less than half-time.  To determine this you will       
              have to scan the entire employment section for R                
              (Q.Y4-Q.Y20a) to determine if R has information in more than    
              one employment category.  If so, you will then need to          
              determine the number of hours worked at the current job         
              (Q.Y6a) and assign R to the combination category e.g.,          
              working now and student) depending on whether they work 20      
              hrs+ or less.  This is done for all respondents.  If R is       
              working now only assign code 10 regardless of number of         
              hours worked in Q.Y6a.

              Q.Y42.  There's been some talk these days about different       
              social classes.  Most people say they belong either to the      
              MIDDLE CLASS or the WORKING CLASS.  Do you ever think of        
              yourself as belonging in one of these classes?

              studies but is informative about noninterview cases, e.g.       
              refusals, on a more detailed level than V2007.                  
                                                                              
              This variable represents a collapsing of 1991 telephone         
              interviewing result codes (which differ substantially from      
              personal interviewing result codes).  Note that some cases      
              were 'predisposed' as nonsample (code 75) or noninterview       
                                                                              
              (code 65).                                                      
                                                                              
              Cases 'predisposed' as NONSAMPLE were cases where the           
              respondent was known in advance to have no telephone, had       
              refused to give a telephone number, or where the number         
              given was known to be invalid, etc. so that R could not be      
              phoned.  38 of these 'predisposed' nonsample cases were not     
              assigned 1991 IDs (V2002) because they were not sent to the     
              Telephone Facility; the other 12 'predisposed' nonsample        
              cases were assigned IDs (and interviewers) before the           
              preexistant condition was noted or confirmed.  Nonsample        
              cases coded "70" are those cases where R was called at what     
              was thought to be a correct number but where it was             
              discovered that the telephone number was incorrect, the         
              telephone was disconnected, etc.  Code 70 also includes         
              several cases where R needed to be interviewed in Spanish:      
              there did not exist a Spanish language version of the 1991      
              Pilot interview.                                                
                                                                              
              Cases 'predisposed' as NONINTERVIEW were cases where it was     
              known in advance that R was deceased, was deaf or had a         
              hearing problem, was too disabled, weak, or feeble to           
              answere or sit at a telephone, or was otherwise physically      
              or mentally restricted from participating in a phone            
              interview.  2 'predisposed' noninterview cases were not         
              assigned 1991 IDs (V2002) while 20 have 1991 IDs, for           
              reasons similar to those mentioned above for 'predisposed'      
              nonsample cases.  Noninterviews which were neither              
              'predisposed' nor refusals (code 60) contain the usual          
              nonrefusal noninterview types:  upon calling, R is              
              discovered to be deceased, ill, residing or traveling           
              elsewhere and unavailable; never at home when called; no        
              answere, etc.  It should also be noted that among               
              NONINTERVIEWS are some cases where respondents did not have     
              a telephone but did have a contact person through whom NES      
              attempted to reach R.

              B1a.  I'd like to get your feelings toward some of our          
              political leaders and other people who have been in the         
              news.  I'll read the name of a person  and I'd like you to      
              rate that person using something called the feeling             
              thermometer.  You can choose any number between 0 and 100.      
              The higher the number, the warmer or more favorable you feel    
              toward that person; the lower the number, the colder or less    
              favorable. You would rate the  person at the 50 degree mark     
              if you feel neither warm nor cold toward them.  If we come      
              to a person whose name you don't recognize, you don't need      
              to rate that person.  Just tell me and we'll move on to the     
              next one.

              D1.  We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and        
              conservatives.  Please think of a seven-point scale on which    
              the political views that people might hold are arranged from    
              extremely liberal to extremely conservative.  On this scale,    
              a measurement of one means extremely liberal political          
              views, and a measurement of seven means extremely               
              conservative political views.  Moderate or middle of the        
              road is at point 4, and of course there are points in           
              between at 2, 3, 5, and 6.                                      
                                                                              
              Where would you place yourself on this scale, or haven't you    
              thought much about this?

              general.  We want to see how you feel about these ideas. For    
              example:

              before the war in the Persian Gulf started, Congress debated    
                                                                              
              whether to continue economic sanctions or to give President     
              Bush the authority to use military forces to get Iraq out of    
              Kuwait.  At that time, were you for continuing to rely on       
              sanctions, or were you in favor of authorizing the President    
              to use military force, or didn't you have an opinion on         
              this?

              near where civilians live because it is immoral to risk         
              innocent lives.  Others say such bombing may be necessary in    
              wartime.  Which of these is closest to your position: (that     
              there should be no bombing near where civilians live, or        
              that such bombing may be necessary in wartime?)

              F15.  Some people think that the U.S. and its allies should     
              have continued to fight Iraq until Saddam Hussein was driven    
              from power.  Others think that the U.S. was right to stop       
              fighting after Kuwait was liberated.  What do you think?        
              Should the war have continued or should it have stopped?

              Others say that such preference in hiring and promotion of      
              blacks is wrong because it gives blacks advantages they

              This weight compensates for the unequal probabilities of        
              selection for respondents in different size households and      
              for differential nonresponse across geographic sample design    
              categories and between panel and cross-section respondents.     
              It is post-stratified to 1990 Census proportions for 24 age     
              by sex by Census region categories. This is a 5 digit           
              variable with 4 decimal places.  The weight is centered         
              with a mean of 1.0.                                             
                                                                              
              This is the first time that NES has put out a weight which      
              compensates for nonresponse, although it has now become a       
              fairly standard part of survey data collections. Such a         
              weight is  particularly appropriate for descriptive             
              statistics.

              There were two forms for both the pre-election and post-        
              election  questionnaires.  One, the "long questionnaire" was    
              the standard form designed to be used for all face-to-face      
              interviews.  The other, the "short questionnaire" was a         
              truncated version of the questionnaire which was designed       
                                                                              
              solely to interview over the phone panel respondents who        
              since 1990 had moved to areas where SRC no longer had           
              interviewers. The short version of the instrument should not    
              have been used with cross-section cases; however, 4 cases       
              were administered using these short questionnaires in error     
              (code 4).  Regrettably, some panel respondents who had not      
              moved out of range were administered the short form of the      
              questionnaire. This variable in conjunction with v3071 will     
              identify these cases.   These problems of administration are    
              described in the introduction and in Technical Report #43,      
              available from NES Project Staff.                               
                                                                              
              The Spanish Language short questionnaire was administered       
              both to cross-section respondents and to panel respondents

              This is a 3-digit variable.  The first digit indicates          
              whether a sample point comes from the 1990 sample (1=panel),    
              or from the 1992 (2=fresh cross-section).  The last 2 digits    
              denote the primary area.  Please note that: Monroe and          
              Ashley County AR both share PA# 77, and Phillips County, KS     
              and Saline, NE share PA #68.  The original 1990 Primary         
              areas Monroe (68) and Saline (70) were depleted, so new         
              Primary areas had to be selected from the same sample

              either the FIPS State Code (v3018) or the ICPSR State Code      
              (v3017), gives the congressional district for the sample        
              location in which the R resided at the time of our initial      
              interview with him/her in 1990 (panel respondents) or 1992      
              (cross-section respondents). This variable reflects the         
              redistricting based on the 1990 Census, in effect for the       
              1992 General Election.

              in which panel R's lived in 1992, due to mobility, nor is it    
              necessarily the district in which an R, cross-section or        
              panel, voted in 1992, since respondents may have two            
              residences, move bewtween the Pre- and Post-Election            
              studies, be voting from a previous residence, etc. Variable     
              5001 records the ICPSR state and district where R voted if

              The term incumbent as used in an election held just after       
              redistricting requires some definition.  An incumbent, as we    
              use the term here and throughout the study, is a person who     
              was in the 102nd Congress, just preceding this election.        
              The incumbent may or may not have represented the particular    
              piece of geography which is the sample segment in which the     
              R was interviewed.  That is, the incumbent may or may not       
              have been R's representative in the preceding Congress.  All    
              incumbent related variables in the study should be used with    
              this caution in mind. See also V7001.

              The November 3rd election for the House of Representatives      
              in Louisiana is really a primary run-off for the state.         
              Congressional district 06 (LA06), a "new district," fielded     
              candidates Richard H. Baker and Clyde C. Holloway, both of      
              whom are Republicans and incumbents from old districts.  In     
              other circumstances, both would have been assigned #34 in       
              the candidate list.  In order to avoid restructuring the        
              questionnaire, the House race in LA06 was treated as an open    
              race with Baker #31 and Holloway #32.  Code 45 in 3021          
              should be used to exclude these cases from analysis

              Substantial reapportionment following the 1990 Census           
                                                                              
              occurred between the elections to the 102nd Congress (1990)     
              and the 103rd Congress (1992).  Variables 3019 and 3020 give    
              the 1992 and the 1990 congressional district numbers for the    
              sample address in which the respondent resided at the time      
              of their Pre-election interview.                                
                                                                              
              Redistricting between the 1990 and 1992 elections was quite     
              extensive.  As district boundary lines changed, it is           
              possible that the incumbent running for re-election in a        
              respondent's district was not the incumbent who had             
              previously represented the segment in which the respondent      
              lived.  For example, for the 102nd Congress, Ann Arbor,         
              Michigan was in Michigan's 2nd District represented by Carl     
              Pursell.  After redistricting, Ann Arbor was part of the        
              13th Congressional District whose incumbent, Representative     
              William Ford, ran for re-election to the 103rd Congress.        
              Ford's constituents now include Ann Arborites who had           
              previously been part of the 2nd District.  These                
              constituents would be coded "2" on variable 7001, which         
              basically records whether respondent was represented by the     
              same or different incumbents in the 102nd and 103rd             
              Congresses.                                                     
                                                                              
                   0.  Neither of the candidates for the 103rd Congress       
                       runing in respondents district was an incumbent in     
                       the 102nd Congress.

                       sample segment in which respondent resided in 1992,    
                       is the same incumbent who represented that segment     
                       in the 102nd Congress.                                 
                   2.  The incumbent who ran for re-election in               
                       respondent's district in 1992 did not represent        
                       the sample segment in which respondent lives in        
                       the 102nd Congress.

              In order that analyses of respondents' reactions to the         
              campaigns not be confounded with ease or difficulty of          
              contacting respondents and persuading them to be                
              interviewed, NES has, since 1984, followed a strategy of        
              releasing Pre-election sample in stages.  In 1984 and 1988,     
              there were four two-week target periods.  In 1992, because      
              the sample design was unusually complicated, and quartering     
              the sample would have resulted in cost inefficiencies, we       
              released panel and cross-section sample in four week target     
              periods.  The assignment of sample lines to target periods      
              was random. The sets of assigned lines are known as             
              "replicates."   The first replicate (55% of the sample          
              thought to be necessary if response and eligibility rates       
              were as estimated) was released on September 1st, the second    
              (45%) on October 1st.                                           
                                                                              
              Three replicates were designated as "reserve" to release as     
              needed, depending on an evaluation of sample performance as     
              of September 30th.  At that time, it was decided to release     
              Reserve Replicates 4 and 5 on October 1st along with            
              replicate 2.  (Although Reserve Replicate 3 was not             
              released, 12 respondents were interviewed from that             
              replicate, in error.)

              The study design called for face-to-face interviews for all     
              respondents except for a few panel respondents who had moved    
              out of the range of SRC interviewers. See v3071 for coding      
              of whether the respondents were in range or not. A              
              SHORT-FORM or abbreviated questionnaire (both English and       
              Spanish) was prepared to use with these respondents over the    
              phone. See v3011 which records use of short-form versus         
              long-form questionnaires.  Telephone interviews were in fact    
              taken with a number of cross- section respondents and a         
              number of panel respondents who had not moved out of range.

              An incentive experiment was implemented in the 1991 Panel       
              study to determine whether a modest incentive would improve     
              response rate. Some respondents received a U of M pen along     
              with a letter asking for their participation, others            
              received the letter only.  In 1992 all selected households      
              were sent an incentive also with the usual advance letter.      
              Respondents who had been sent a pen in 1991 were sent a book    
              of stamps in 1992.

              These FIPS SMSA codes were obtained from the Federal            
              Information Processing Standard Publication, U.S. Department    
              of Commerce, National Bureau of Standards.                      
                                                                              
              The 1980 SMSA Codes have for the most part been carried over    
              by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to the 1990        
              Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA's).  However, some MSA      
              names and definitions have been modified by OMB to reflect      
              shifts in population and changes in characteristics of          
              areas.  In the 1992 NES data, the 1980 SMSA codes have been     
              retained for all parts of the MSA primary sampling units        
              (PSU's).  It should be remembered that, particularly in the     
              case of PMSAs (which are part of consolidated areas (or         
              CMSAs) some counties or county parts may in 1990 be defined     
              by OMB as part of a different PMSA (a good example is           
              Chicago, IL).  It was felt that for NES analysis, to retain     
              the older SMSA codes, which correspond to the 1980 sampling     
              frame used for this sample, was most appropriate for all MSA    
                                                                              
              or PMSA areas.                                                  
                                                                              
              In those areas designated "Non-SMSA" in our sample frame        
              ("Non-MSA" on most of our documentation for 1992 NES), there    
              are two PSUs (#64, Gardner, MA, and #82, El Dorado/Alpine,      
              CA) in which some of the 1980 rural area has in 1990 met the    
              requirements for inclusion in an MSA; in these cases the        
              size of place code was modified to reflect this and the 1990    
              MSA number is indicated for the affected segments (Core         
              segment 009 in Gardner, MA, where Barre town--not associated

              The Selection Table is used to select a respondent from all     
              household members who are eligible adults.  (An eligible        
              adult is a U.S. citizen who is 18 years of age or older by      
              Election Day.)  The Selection Table appears on the              
              Coversheet below the Household Listing.                         
                                                                              
              After a complete listing of the HH is taken, each eligible      
              adult is assigned a "Number" based on the criteria of gender    
              and age [beginning with the oldest male as number 1, males      
              are numbered by increments of 1 according to descending age;    
              females are numbered by descending age starting with the        
              number one higher than that assigned to the youngest male].     
              The interviewer then uses the Selection Table to determine      
              the "Number" of the eligible adult to be interviewed.           
                                                                              
              The Selection Table itself consists of 2 parallel columns.      
              In the first column the interviewer circles the total number    
              of eligible adults in the household; in the second column       
              (same row) is identified the "Number" of the person who will    
              be the respondent.  Below is an example of what one             
              Selection Table looks like [Table A]:

              There are 8 different Selection Tables used and they are        
              randomly assigned.  [Note that although only 8 tables are       
              used, there are 12 codes in this variable because the 8         
              tables are used in cycles of 12; this procedure is used to      
              equalize the probability of selection for each eligible         
              adult].  A summary describing all 8 Selection Tables appears

              and marital status variable (Y2) for information about other

              (1) questions Y55-Y55d for information about R's children       
              and children for which R is responsible living with R at        
              least half time; and (2), since no HH composition variable      
              is present, marital status (Y2) and question Y39 for            
              information about other "adults."  This means that for Panel    
              cases coded 30-31, a person counted as another "adult" may      
              include a household member 14-17 years old as well as           
              persons 18 or older.  Panel cases coded 10 and 11 correspond    
              to 1 in Y39, codes 20 and 21 correspond to 1 and 7 in Y2        
              (marital status), and codes 30-31 correspond to cases coded     
              2 in Y39 and not 1 nor 7 in Y2.                                 
                                                                              
              In all cases coded 20-21, adults other than R and spouse may    
              also be in household.

              for sure whether or not you voted in that election?

              our political leaders and other people who are in the news      
              these days.                                                     
                                                                              
              I'll read the name of a person and I'd like you to rate that    
              person using something we call the feeling thermometer.         
                                                                              
              Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you        
              feel favorable and warm toward the person.                      
                                                                              
              Ratings between 0 degrees and 50 degrees mean that you don't    
              feel favorable toward the person and that you don't care too    
              much for that person.                                           
                                                                              
              You would rate the person at the 50 degree mark if you don't    
              feel particularly warm or cold toward the person.  If we        
              come to a person whose name you don't recognize, you don't      
              need to rate that person.  Just tell me and we'll move on to    
              the next one.                                                   
                                                                              
              Our first person is George Bush.  How would you rate him        
              using the thermometer?

              know" do you mean that you don't know who the person is, or     
              do you have something else in mind?

              liberals and conservatives.  Here is a 7-point scale on         
              which the political views that people might hold are            
              arranged from extremely liberal to extremely conservative.

              haven't you thought much about this?

              G5.  (RB, P. 7) Some people say that there are certain          
              qualities that make a person a true American. Others say        
              that there isn't anything that makes one person more            
              American than another.  I'm going to read some of the things    
              that have been mentioned. For each of the following, tell me    
              how important you think it is in making someone a true          
              American -- extremely important, very (important), somewhat     
              (important), or not at all important.

              G6.  (RB, P. 8) Some people say that it is better for           
              America if different racial and ethnic groups maintain their

              idea of a melting pot.  Which of these positions comes          
              closer to your own opinion:  Racial and ethnic groups should

              NOTE: J10-J11b presented difficult problems for interviewers

              incumbent of the 102nd Congress running for re-election as      
              the district was constituted for the 103 rd Congress.  Thus,    
              many respondents were asked to evaluate the performance of      
              an incumbent who was not their Representative in the 102nd      
              Congress.  Second, primaries were not held in FL, AZ, CT,NH,    
              LA, MA MN NY, WA, WI until after the start of interviewing      
              on September 1, so in many cases names of candidates were       
              not decided at the start of interviewing.  The candidate        
              names were given to interviewers as soon as they became         
              available.

                       faced with an international problem; might make us

                       (mideast) oil for energy; made us less willing to

                       makes it easier for us to use force again when

               1  73.  Oil Dependency--increased our dependence on            
                       (mideast) oil for energy; made us less willing to      
                       develop other sources of energy                        
               7  74.  Financial Cost--we spent a lot of money; lost a lot

              L1.  (RB, P. 13) Some people think the government should        
              provide fewer services, even in areas such as health and        
              education in order to reduce spending. Suppose these people     
              are at one end of the scale at point 1. Other people feel it    
              is important for the government to provide many more            
              services even if it means an increase in spending.  Suppose     
              these people are at the other end, at point 7.  And of          
              course, some other people have opinions somewhere in between    
              at points 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

              L2.  (RB, P. 14) Some people believe that we should spend       
              much less money for defense.  Others feel that defense          
              spending should be greatly increased.

              L5.  (RB, P. 15) There is much concern about the rapid rise     
              in medical and hospital costs.  Some people feel there          
              should be a government insurance plan which would cover all     
              medical and hospital expenses for everyone.  Others feel        
              that all medical expenses should be paid by individuals, and    
              through private insurance plans like Blue Cross or other        
              company paid plans.

              L7.  (RB, P. 16) Some people feel the government in             
              Washington should see to it that every person has a job and     
              a good standard of living.  Others think the government         
              should just let each person get ahead on their own.             
                                                                              
              L7a.  Where would you place yourself on this scale, or          
              haven't you thought much about this?

              L8.  (RB, P. 17) Some people feel that the government in        
              Washington should make every effort to improve the social       
              and economic position of blacks.  Others feel that the          
              government should not make any special effort to help blacks    
              because they should help themselves.

              L19.  (RB, P. 19) There is much discussion about the best       
              way to deal with the problem of urban unrest and rioting.       
              Some say it is more important to use all available force to     
              maintain law and order -- no matter what results.  Others       
              say it is more important to correct the problems of poverty     
              and unemployment that give rise to the disturbances. And, of    
              course, other people have opinions in between.                  
                                                                              
              L19a.  Where would you place yourself on this scale, or

              NOTE: Due to a design error, abbreviated telephone (short       
              form) and Spanish language questionnaires were produced with    
              the L19a scale printed reversed in the text. Because            
              interviewers handled this problem in different ways, it was     
              impossible to determine which scale position a number given     
              by Rs response corresponds.  Therefore, all cases of short      
              form or Spanish questionnaires (3,4,6,7 in V3011) have been     
              coded 9 (NA) in L19a.

              M1.  (RB, P. 20) Recently there has been a lot of talk about    
              women's rights. Some people feel that women should have an      
              equal role with men in running business, industry, and          
              government.  Others feel that women's place is in the home.

              M2.  Some people have suggested placing new limits on           
              foreign imports in order to protect American jobs. Others       
              say that such limits would raise consumer prices and hurt       
              American exports.  Do you favor or oppose placing new limits    
              on imports, or haven't you thought much about this?

              religious services even if they want to. Thinking about your

              apart from occasional weddings, baptisms or funerals?

              This set of religion codes, which was first used in the NES     
              time series in 1990, was developed by a group of scholars       
              headed by David Leege of the University of Notre Dame and is    
              still in the process of refinement.  A few changes have been    
              made since the 1990 version: codes 127 and 133 have been        
              combined into code 127 [no 1992 code 133]; code 102 has been    
              moved to become code 306 [no 1992 code 102]; and codes 267      
              and 261 have been added [new].                                  
                                                                              
              Those interested in comparing 1992 codes to the set of codes    
              in use through 1988, please see Addendum B                      
                                                                              
              Users who wish to understand the inner working of the           
              religion section and summary are strongly encouraged to

              X4e, X4f, X4g, X4h, X4i, X4j; open-ended responses for codes    
              18, 19, 21, 31 in X4) have been hand-coded into this summary    
              variable.  1990 data for panel short form cases (3 in V3011)    
              have been added to this variable (Although 1990 data were       
              not added to the individual variables from which the summary    
              was built).                                                     
                                                                              
              R's with NO RELIGIOUS PREFERENCE OR IDENTIFICATION have in

              consistency with past practice, such cases appear in missing    
              data code 0 in this variable, but some users may wish to

              status from 1990 was copied here.  For 22 cases the 1990        
              data were inconsistent with the Y21 CHECKPOINT in 1992,         
              alerting us to possible changes in marital status.  Each

              from the cover sheet, the thumbnail sketch and other

              NES income variables traditionally are administered by          
              showing respondents a list of income groups (24 categories      
              in all), and asking them which one corresponds to their         
              situation.  This procedure cannot be easily duplicated over     
              the phone.  Income information from the "long form"             
              questionnaire was originally coded in variables 4103-4105.      
              Information from the "short form" telephone questionnaire       
              was coded in variables 4106-4110.  For the users'               
              convenience the information from the "short form" was copied    
              into variables 4103-4105.  For a complete layout of the         
              income section in each form please see the composite

              middle class or the working class.  Do you ever think of        
              yourself as belonging in one of these classes?

              The study design called for face-to-face interviews for all     
              respondents except for a few panel respondents who had moved    
              out of the range of  SRC interviewers. See v3071 for coding     
              of whether the respondents were in range or not. A              
              SHORT-FORM or abbreviated questionnaire was prepared to use     
              with these respondents over the phone. See v5002 which          
              records use of short-form versus long- form questionnaires.     
              Telephone interviews were in fact taken with a number of

              Throughout the post-election questionnaire, whenever the        
              term "incumbents" is used in the documentation or               
              questionnaire , we are referring to a representative who was    
              a member of the 102nd Congress, i.e, prior to the 1992          
              General election.  Due to the U.S. Census based                 
              redistricting, the incumbents district for the 103rd            
              Congress may consist of a fairly different geographical area    
              from the area covered by the district prior to the boundary     
              changes.  Therefore, the "incumbent" may or may not have        
              been the respondent's district's incumbent before 1992.         
                                                                              
              An additional complication is that a panel respondent may       
              have moved since we interviewed them in 1990, or                
              pre-election respondents may have moved between the pre- and    
              the post-election interview. Unless stated otherwise survey     
              questions always refer to R's original locations.               
                                                                              
              A4.  As you know, representatives to Congress in Washington     
              were chosen in this election from congressional districts       
              all around the country. How much would you say that you         
              personally cared about the way the election to the U.S.         
              House of Representatives came out:  did you care very much,     
              pretty much, not very much, or not at all?

              I'd like to get your feelings toward some of our political      
              leaders and other people who are in the news these days.        
              I'll read the name of a person and I'd like you to rate that    
              person using something we call the feeling thermometer.         
              Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you        
              feel favorable and warm toward that person.                     
                                                                              
              Ratings between 0 degrees and 50 degrees mean that you don't    
              feel favorable toward the person and that you don't care too    
              much for that person.  You would rate the person at the 50      
              degree mark if you don't feel particularly warm or cold         
                                                                              
              toward the person. If we come to a person whose name you        
              don't recognize, you don't need to rate that person. Just       
              tell me and we'll move on to the next one.                      
                                                                              
              Our first person is George Bush.  How would you rate him        
              using the feeling thermometer?

              election to fill an unexpired term.  Vote for the regular       
              election is duplicated here.  See D10b1/D12a1 and

              In two cases R voted in CA, outside state of sample address.    
              Because there is only one variable for Senate vote for Rs       
              not living in California, R's vote in the regular (full         
              term) CA Senate election has been coded here.  These two Rs'    
              votes in the special CA Senate election are as follow:  post

              J1.  Some say that the civil rights people have been trying     
              to push too fast.  Others feel they haven't pushed fast         
              enough.  How about you:  Do you think that civil rights         
              leaders are trying to push too fast, are going too slowly,      
              or are they moving at about the right speed?

              J5.  Some people say that because of past discrimination,       
              blacks should be given preference in hiring and promotion.      
              Others say that such preference in hiring and promotion of      
              blacks is wrong because it gives blacks advantages they         
              haven't earned.  What about your opinion--are you for or        
              against preferential hiring and promotion of blacks?

              is sometimes necessary for colleges and universities to         
              reserve openings for black students.  Others oppose quotas      
              because they say quotas give blacks advantages they haven't     
              earned. What about your opinion--are you for or against

              individual.  Others think that while individual effort is       
              important, the best way for women to really improve their       
              position is if they work together.  Which is closest to your

              kinds of things people tell us when we interview them and       
              ask you whether you agree or disagree with them.  I'll read     
              them one at a time and you just tell me whether you agree or    
              disagree.

              shouldn't vote in it.

              People have different ideas about the government in             
              Washington.  These ideas don't refer to Democrats or            
              Republicans in particular, but just to the government in        
              general.  We want to see how you feel about these ideas. For    
              example:

              government in Washington to do what is right--just about        
              always, most of the time, or only some of the time?

              P3.  (RB, P. 18) Now I have some questions about different      
              groups in our society.  I'm going to show you a seven-point     
              scale on which the characteristics of the people in a group     
              can be rated.  In the first statement a score of 1 means        
              that you think almost all of the people in that group tend      
              to be "hard-working."  A score of 7 means that almost all of    
              the people in the group are "lazy."  A score of 4 means that    
              you think that most people in the group are not closer to       
              one end or the other, and of course you may choose any          
              number in between.

              Q4.  (RB, P. 22) Many different groups of people have come      
              to the United States at different times in our history.  In     
              recent years the population of the United States has been       
              changing to include many more people of Hispanic and Asian      
              background.  I'm going to read a list of things that people     
              say may happen because of the growing number of Hispanic        
              people in the United States.  For each of these things,         
              please say how likely it is to happen.                          
                                                                              
              Q4a.  How likely is it that the growing number of Hispanics     
              will improve our culture with new ideas and                     
              customs--extremely likely, very likely, somewhat likely, or

              This weight should be used in analyses in which the 1992 NES    
              is being compared to earlier unwighted National Election        
              Studies data collections.  Variable 7000 corrects for panel     
              attrition and for the aging of the panel respondents.           
              Details on the construction of this variable are provided in    
              the Sample Design section of the introductory materials for     
              the 1992 Pre- and Post-Election Survey.

              Substantial reapportionment following the 1990 Census           
              occurred between the elections to the 102nd Congress (1990)     
              and the 103rd Congress (1992).  Variables 3019 and 3020 give    
              the 1992 and the 1990 congressional district numbers for the    
              sample address in which the respondent resided at the time      
              of their Pre-election interview.                                
                                                                              
              Redistricting between the 1990 and 1992 elections was quite     
              extensive.  As district boundary lines changed, it is           
              possible that the incumbent running for re-election in a        
              respondent's district was not the incumbent who had             
              previously represented the segment in which the respondent      
              lived.  For example, for the 102nd Congress, Ann Arbor,         
              Michigan was in Michigan's 2nd District represented by Carl     
              Pursell.  After redistricting, Ann Arbor was part of the        
              13th Congressional District whose incumbent, Representative     
              William Ford, ran for re-election to the 103rd Congress.        
              Ford's constituents now include Ann Arborites who had           
              previously been part of the 2nd District.  These                
              constituents would be coded "2" on variable 7001, which         
              basically records whether respondent was represented by the     
              same or different incumbents in the 102nd and 103rd             
              Congresses.                                                     
                                                                              
             416  0.  Neither of the candidates for the 103rd Congress        
                      runing in respondents district was an incumbent in      
                      the 102nd Congress.                                     
            1555  1.  The incumbent who ran for re-election to the 103rd      
                      Congress in the congressional district for the          
                      sample segment in which respondent resided in 1992,     
                      is the same incumbent who represented that segment      
                      in the 102nd Congress.                                  
             391  2.  The incumbent who ran for re-election in                
                      respondent's district in 1992 did not represent the     
                      sample segment in which respondent lives in the         
                      102nd Congress.
