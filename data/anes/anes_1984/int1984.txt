>> 1984 STUDY DESCRIPTION

      THE NES/CPS AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY, 1984, WAS
      CONDUCTED BY THE CENTER FOR POLITICAL STUDIES OF THE
      INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH, UNDER THE GENERAL DIRECTION
      OF WARREN E. MILLER.  SANTA TRAUGOTT IS THE DIRECTOR OF
      STUDIES.  THIS IS THE EIGHTEENTH IN A SERIES OF STUDIES OF
      AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTIONS PRODUCED BY THE POLITICAL
      BEHAVIOR PROGRAM OF THE SURVEY RESEARCH CENTER AND THE
      CENTER FOR POLITICAL STUDIES, AND IS THE FOURTH STUDY TO BE
      CONDUCTED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION
      GRANTS (NOS. SOC77-08885 AND SES-8341310) PROVIDING
      LONG-TERM SUPPORT FOR THE NATIONAL ELECTION STUDIES.  SINCE
      1978, THE NES ELECTION STUDIES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED BY A
      NATIONAL BOARD OF OVERSEERS, THE MEMBERS OF WHICH MEET
      SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR TO PLAN CONTENT AND ADMINISTRATION OF
      THE MAJOR STUDY COMPONENTS. BOARD MEMBERS DURING THE 1984
      PLANNING PHASE INCLUDED:  RAY WOLFINGER, CHAIR, UNIVERSITY
      OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY; RICHARD A. BRODY, STANFORD
      UNIVERSITY; HEINZ EULAU, STANFORD UNIVERSITY; MORRIS P.
      FIORINA, HARVARD UNIVERSITY; STANLEY KELLEY, JR., PRINCETON
      UNIVERSITY; DONALD R. KINDER, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN; DAVID
      R. MAYHEW, YALE UNIVERSITY; WARREN E. MILLER, ARIZONA STATE
      UNIVERSITY, EX OFFICIO; DAVID O. SEARS, UNIVERSITY OF
      CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES; AND J. MERRILL SHANKS, UNIVERSITY
      OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY.

      AS PART OF THE PLANNING PROCESS, WORKSHOPS MAY BE HELD, A
      SPECIAL PLANNING COMMITTEE APPOINTED, A PILOT STUDY
      CONDUCTED, AND STIMULUS LETTERS SENT TO THE MEMBERS OF THE
      SCHOLARLY COMMUNITY, SOLICITING THEIR INPUT ON STUDY PLANS.

      THE 1984 STUDY PLANNING COMMITTEE INCLUDED SEVERAL BOARD
      MEMBERS (KINDER, CHAIR; BRODY, KELLEY, MILLER, EX OFFICIO;
      SEARS, AND WOLFINGER) AND THREE OTHER SCHOLARS, STANLEY
      FELDMAN, UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY; ETHEL KLEIN, COLUMBIA
      UNIVERSITY; AND STEVEN J. ROSENSTONE, YALE UNIVERSITY.

      THE PLANNING COMMITTEE BEGAN MEETING IN FEBRUARY OF 1983.  A
      PILOT STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN THE SUMMER OF 1983 FOR THE
      PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING NEW INSTRUMENTATION FOR THE 1984
      ELECTION STUDY. NEW ITEMS WERE TESTED ON ECONOMIC
      WELL-BEING, GROUP IDENTIFICATION, VALUES, POLITICAL
      PARTICIPATION AND CANDIDATE AFFECT.  DATA FROM THE PILOT
      STUDY ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE INTER-UNIVERSITY CONSORTIUM
      FOR POLITICAL AND SOCIAL RESEARCH (ICPSR 8178).  RESULTS
      FROM THE PILOT STUDY WERE USED BY THE PLANNING COMMITTEE IN
      FORMULATING RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD ABOUT STUDY CONTENT
      FOR THE 1984 ELECTION STUDY. (SEE THE LIST OF PILOT STUDY
      REPORTS.)

      THE 1984 NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY HAD TWO MAJOR COMPONENTS.
      THIS DOCUMENT DESCRIBES THE NOW TRADITIONAL PRE- AND
      POST-PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SURVEY PANEL.  THE OTHER MAJOR
      COMPONENT IS A CONTINUOUS MONITORING EFFORT, WHICH CONSISTS
      OF 3496 INTERVIEWS TAKEN IN 46 INDEPENDENT, CONSECUTIVE
      SAMPLES.  INTERVIEW ADMINISTRATION WAS TELEPHONE; THE SAMPLE
      SELECTION WAS BY A RANDOM DIGIT DIALING PROCEDURE.  THIS
      DATASET IS ALSO AVAILABLE FROM THE INTER-UNIVERSITY 
      CONSORTIUM, WITH DOCUMENTATION AND DESCRIPTION EQUIVALENT TO
      THIS.

>> 1984 SURVEY CONTENT AND ADMINISTRATION                  

      THE BOARD OF OVERSEERS BALANCED A NUMBER OF CONSIDERATIONS
      IN SELECTING CONTENT FOR THE PRE- AND POST-PRESIDENTIAL
      ELECTION SURVEY PANEL.  THERE WAS, AS ALWAYS, THE NECESSITY
      OF MAINTAINING CONTINUITY WITH PAST SURVEYS, SO THAT
      MEASURES WHICH HAVE REACHED THE STATUS OF TIME SERIES OR
      "CORE" COULD BE MAINTAINED.  ALL SO-CALLED "CORE" ITEMS WERE
      EVALUATED BY THE BOARD AND INPUT SOLICITED FROM THE USER
      COMMUNITY ABOUT WHETHER EACH SHOULD BE RETAINED.

      ROOM HAD TO BE MADE FOR THE ADDITION OF NEW CONTENT, MOST OF
      WHICH HAD BEEN "PILOTED" IN 1983.  EXAMPLES OF NEW CONTENT
      ARE THE ECONOMIC INDIVIDUALISM AND EGALITARIAN ITEMS (QS F1
      AND J1) AND THE GROUP IDENTIFICATION ITEMS.

      IT WAS DESIRED ALSO TO TAKE SOMEWHAT MORE ADVANTAGE OF THE
      PANEL DESIGN AND ALLOCATE SEVERAL MINUTES IN THE POST TO
      QUESTIONS ASKED IN THE PRE AND DEEMED TO BE
      "CAMPAIGN-REACTIVE." SEVERAL ISSUE QUESTIONS, TRAITS,
      AFFECTS, POLITICAL EFFICACY ITEMS, PARTY IDENTIFICATION AND
      LIBERAL-CONSERVATIVE SELF-PLACEMENT WERE REPEATED FOR THIS
      REASON.

      ANOTHER CONCERN WAS TO MAINTAIN SIMILARITY OF CONTENT WITH
      CONTINUOUS MONITORING, WHICH WAS IN THE FIELD
      SIMULTANEOUSLY, KEEPING IN MIND THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOME
      SCHOLARS MAY WISH TO "POOL" THE TWO DATASETS.

      THE BOARD SET TWO BASIC DESIGN PARAMETERS RELATING TO SURVEY
      ADMINISTRATION.  IN THE PRE-ELECTION WAVE, THE SURVEY WAS TO
      BE ADMINISTERED IN TWO-WEEK "QUARTERS." IN THE
      POST-ELECTION, HALF OF THE RESPONDENTS WERE TO BE
      INTERVIEWED IN PERSON, THE OTHER HALF BY TELEPHONE.

      INTERVIEW TARGET PERIODS.  IF ONE THINKS THAT THERE IS SOME
      AMOUNT OF RELATIVELY LATE VOTE DECISION-MAKING, THEN ONE
      WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A MEASURE OF VOTE DECISION BY TIME OF
      INTERVIEW WHICH IS NOT CONTAMINATED BY THE DIFFICULTY OF
      OBTAINING AN INTERVIEW. THAT IS, IF THE ENTIRE SAMPLE IS
      RELEASED IMMEDIATELY, AND IF THE MOST RELUCTANT AND
      HARD-TO-REACH RESPONDENTS ARE SYSTEMATICALLY INTERVIEWED
      LATER IN THE INTERVIEW PERIOD THAN ARE MORE AMENABLE
      RESPONDENTS, AND IF THE HARDER-TO-REACH RESPONDENTS ALSO
      DECIDE LATER (AND/OR DIFFERENTLY) THAN OTHER RESPONDENTS,
      THEN THE VOTE DECISION BY TIME OF INTERVIEW RELATIONSHIP IS
      CONFOUNDED.

      THIS LOGIC LED THE BOARD TO DECIDE THAT THE SAMPLE SHOULD BE
      ADMINISTERED IN FOUR TWO-WEEK QUARTERS.  THE FIELD PERIOD
      WAS TO BEGIN ON WEDNESDAY, SEPT. 5.  (IN ACTUAL PRACTICE, A
      FEW INTERVIEWERS "JUMPED THE GUN" AND SEVERAL EARLY
      INTERVIEWS WERE TAKEN ON TUESDAY, THE TRADITIONAL NES
      STARTING DAY.)


      THE FIRST QUARTER ENDED TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 18TH.  THE SECOND
      QUARTER WAS SEPT.19TH - OCT.2ND; THE 3RD QUARTER WAS OCT.
      3RD THROUGH OCT. 16TH; AND THE LAST QUARTER WAS OCT. 17TH -
      OCT. 31.  THAT LEFT THE NOV. 1 - NOV. 5 PERIOD FOR
      "CATCH-UP" INTERVIEWS.

      IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT INTERVIEWS WITH SELECTED
      RESPONDENTS WHICH COULD NOT BE TAKEN IN THE ASSIGNED SAMPLE
      QUARTER WERE NONETHELESS TAKEN AS THE RESPONDENTS WERE
      AVAILABLE. NINETY-THREE PERCENT OF ALL INTERVIEWS WERE TAKEN
      WITHIN THE TARGET PERIOD.  VARIABLE 840027 RECORDS INFORMATION
      ABOUT TARGET PERIOD ASSIGNMENT AND SUCCESS. ONE QUARTER OF
      EACH SEGMENT (SEE 1984 SAMPLE DESIGN) WAS ASSIGNED TO EACH
      TWO-WEEK TARGET PERIOD (RATHER THAN ONE QUARTER OF THE SET
      OF SEGMENTS AT EACH PERIOD).

      TELEPHONE VS. IN-PERSON ASSIGNMENT.  TELEPHONE INTERVIEWING
      HAS ADVANTAGES OVER IN-PERSON INTERVIEWING IN TERMS OF COST
      AND THE SPEED WITH WHICH INTERVIEWING CAN BE COMPLETED.  ON
      THE OTHER HAND, IN-PERSON INTERVIEWS SEEM TO HAVE BETTER
      RESPONSE RATES AND CAN BE LONGER THAN TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS,
      FOR WHICH 50 MINUTES IS USUALLY REGARDED AS PRESSING (OR
      EXCEEDING) TOLERABLE LIMITS.

      A SAMPLE DERIVED BY A RANDOM DIGIT DIAL METHOD HAS THE
      DISADVANTAGE THAT IDENTIFICATION OF CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT
      IS NOT AT ALL STRAIGHTFORWARD. MANY RESPONDENTS CANNOT
      IDENTIFY THEIR CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OR CONGRESSPERSON.
      TELEPHONE EXCHANGE, WHICH IS THE ONLY GEOGRAPHIC DESIGNATION
      READILY AVAILABLE, IS NOT AN ACCURATE INDICATION OF
      CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT.

      THEREFORE, THE PRE-ELECTION WAVE WAS TAKEN ENTIRELY
      IN-PERSON. FOR THE POST-ELECTION SURVEY, HOWEVER, WITH
      CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT DETERMINED (AREA SEGMENTS, THE SECOND
      STAGE SAMPLE SELECTIONS, CAN BE ACCURATELY LINKED TO
      CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS), IT WAS DECIDED TO UTILIZE A
      MIXED-MODE DESIGN, WHERE PART OF THE MOTIVATION WAS TO
      ACHIEVE THE ALREADY KNOWN BENEFITS OF TELEPHONE
      INTERVIEWING, PARTICULARLY COST REDUCTION, AND TO LEARN AS
      MUCH AS POSSIBLE ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MODE ON QUESTION
      ANSWERS AND RESPONSE RATE.

      IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MIXED MODE DESIGN, HALF OF THE
      PRE-ELECTION RESPONDENTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO THE
      IN-PERSON MODE.  THE OTHER HALF WERE TO BE INTERVIEWED BY
      TELEPHONE. THE TELEPHONE RESPONDENTS RECEIVED A SHORTENED
      VERSION OF THE PERSONAL INSTRUMENT.  (THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS
      ON THE TELEPHONE QUESTIONNAIRE WHICH ARE NOT ALSO ON THE
      PERSONAL QUESTIONNAIRE.)


      RESPONDENTS WHO DID NOT HAVE A TELEPHONE, OR FOR WHOM THE
      PRE-ELECTION INTERVIEWER INDICATED (IN RESPONSE TO A
      QUESTION ON THE COVER SHEET) THAT AN INTERVIEW SHOULD NOT BE
      ATTEMPTED OVER THE TELEPHONE (R IS DEAF, SPEAKS ENGLISH WITH
      DIFFICULTY, OR OTHER REASON) WERE RE-ASSIGNED TO THE FIELD,
      TO BE INTERVIEWED IN-PERSON BUT USING A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW.
      THE FEW RESPONDENTS WHO WERE ASSIGNED THE IN-PERSON MODE WHO
      HAD TO BE INTERVIEWED OVER THE TELEPHONE RECEIVED A
      SHORTENED PERSONAL INTERVIEW, WITH THOSE QUESTIONS DELETED
      WHICH WERE NOT ASKED ON THE TELEPHONE.  (THEIR RESPONSES TO
      THESE QUESTIONS WERE MARKED NOT ASCERTAINED).   VARIABLE 840063
      COMBINES INFORMATION ABOUT THESE SEVERAL CONTINGENCIES: TO
      WHICH RANDOM HALF A PRE-ELECTION R WAS ORIGINALLY ASSIGNED,
      AND WHICH QUESTIONNAIRE AND MODE HE/SHE ULTIMATELY ENDED UP
      WITH.

>> 1984 SAMPLING INFORMATION                            

      THE 1980 SAMPLING FRAME WAS DESIGNED, SELECTED AND LISTED
      JOINTLY BY NORC AND SRC. THE SAMPLE UNIVERSE INCLUDES ALL
      U.S. HOUSEHOLDS IN THE 48 COTERMINOUS STATES, ALASKA AND
      HAWAII.  CIVILIAN HOUSEHOLDS RESIDING ON MILITARY BASES ARE
      INCLUDED IN THE SAMPLE UNIVERSE.

      THE 1980 NORC/SRC NATIONAL SAMPLE IS A MULTI-STAGE AREA
      PROBABILITY DESIGN. THAT IS, IN A SERIES OF HIERARCHICAL
      STEPS, GEOGRAPHICALLY DEFINED SAMPLING UNITS OF DECREASING
      SIZE ARE SELECTED WITH PROBABILITY PROPORTIONATE TO THEIR
      TOTAL OCCUPIED HOUSING UNIT COUNT.  THE OVERALL SAMPLING
      FRACTION IS 1:25,389.

      THE NATIONAL SAMPLE INCLUDES A FIRST STAGE SELECTION OF
      SMSAS, COUNTIES AND COUNTY GROUPS (PRIMARY AREAS), A SECOND
      STAGE SELECTION OF AREA SEGMENTS (HOUSING UNIT CLUSTERS
      DEFINED BY CENSUS BLOCKS OR SUBSAMPLED PARTS OF SELECTED
      CENSUS ENUMERATION DISTRICTS), A THIRD STAGE SAMPLING OF
      (LISTED) HOUSING UNITS FROM THE SELECTED AREA SEGMENTS, AND,
      FOR THE NES SAMPLE, A FINAL STAGE OF RANDOMLY SELECTING A
      RESPONDENT FROM THE ELIGIBLE MEMBERS OF THE SAMPLE
      HOUSEHOLDS. IN THIS SAMPLE, PRIMARY AREAS CONSIST OF
      COUNTIES, SMSAS, INDEPENDENT CITIES, AND IN NEW ENGLAND,
      PARTS OF COUNTIES. EIGHTY-FOUR PRIMARY AREAS WERE SELECTED
      AT THE FIRST STAGE.

      PRIOR TO SELECTION, PRIMARY AREAS WERE GROUPED INTO 84
      STRATA.  THE STRATA WERE FORMED BY GROUPING METROPOLITAN AND
      NON-METROPOLITAN PAS WITHIN EACH OF THE FOUR CENSUS REGIONS.
      WITHIN EACH REGION, ADDITIONAL VARIABLES WERE USED TO DEFINE
      STRATA.  THE STRATIFYING VARIABLES INCLUDED WITHIN-REGION
      GEOGRAPHY AND SIZE; SIZE WAS MEASURED BY THE 1980 CENSUS
      COUNT OF OCCUPIED HOUSING UNITS.  ONE PSU (PRIMARY SELECTION
      UNIT) WAS SELECTED FROM EACH STRATUM USING A CONTROLLED
      SELECTION PROCEDURE.

      SIXTEEN OF THE SELECTIONS ARE "SELF-REPRESENTING." THAT IS,
      THERE IS ONE AND ONLY ONE SELECTION FROM THAT STRATA BECAUSE
      THE ENTIRE STRATA IS COMPRISED OF AN SMSA.  FOR EXAMPLE, NEW
      YORK AND CHICAGO SMSAS ARE SELF-REPRESENTING.  TECHNICALLY,
      THESE ARE NOT PSUS SINCE THERE IS NO SELECTION AS SUCH
      INVOLVED. FOR THIS REASON THE 84 UNITS IN THE FIRST STAGE OF
      THE SAMPLE SELECTIONS ARE REFERRED TO IN SUBSEQUENT
      DESCRIPTIONS AS PRIMARY AREAS, RATHER THAN PSUS.

      FOR THE 1980 DESIGN, THE DESIGNATED SECOND STAGE SAMPLING
      UNITS (SSUS OR SEGMENTS) ARE COMPRISED OF CENSUS BLOCKS IN
      METROPOLITAN PRIMARY AREAS (OR ENUMERATION DISTRICTS IN SOME
      RURAL AREAS). THIS REPRESENTS A CHANGE FOR SRC WHICH IN 1970
      USED AN INTERMEDIATE STEP OF SELECTING A STRATIFIED SAMPLE
      OF MINOR CIVIL DIVISIONS OR "PLACES" BEFORE SELECTING THE
      SMALLER BLOCK OR ED UNITS.

      SAMPLING OF SECOND STAGE UNITS WAS PERFORMED WITH
      PROBABILITIES PROPORTIONATE TO MEASURES OF SIZE (MOS) -- THE
      TOTAL OCCUPIED HOUSING COUNT FOR THE AREA.  BEFORE SECOND
      STAGE SELECTION TOOK PLACE, SSUS WERE ORDERED OR IMPLICITLY
      STRATIFIED USING A THREE-STEP PROCEDURE.

      FIRST, IN MULTI-COUNTY PRIMARY AREAS, THE SSUS WERE ORDERED
      BY COUNTY ACCORDING TO GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND POPULATION
      SIZE OF THE COUNTY. THIRTY-SIX OF THE EIGHTY-FOUR PRIMARY
      AREAS FELL IN STATES WHERE DATA WERE AVAILABLE FOR THE
      MEDIAN PER CAPITA INCOME FOR EACH MCD.  IN THESE AREAS, EACH
      MCD WAS CLASSIFIED INTO ONE OF THREE POPULATION SIZE, AND
      ONE OF THREE INCOME SIZE, CATEGORIES.  IN ALL PRIMARY AREAS,
      THE FINAL STRATIFICATION STEP WAS TO ORDER INDIVIDUAL CENSUS
      BLOCKS AND ENUMERATION DISTRICTS ACCORDING TO GEOGRAPHIC
      LOCATION.

      THE SECONDARY SELECTIONS (SEGMENTS) WERE MADE USING A
      SYSTEMATIC SELECTION PROCEDURE.  WITHIN THE 6 LARGEST
      PRIMARY AREAS, A VARYING NUMBER OF SEGMENTS CAN BE SELECTED,
      FROM 6 TO ABOUT 25. IN ALL OTHER PRIMARY AREAS, SIX
      SECONDARY SELECTIONS WERE MADE.

      THE MINIMUM SIZE OF A SEGMENT IS 50 OCCUPIED HOUSEHOLDS, BUT
      THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF HOUSING UNIT LISTINGS IN A SEGMENT IS
      ABOUT 92.  IN ORDER TO MAKE MANAGEABLE THE SUBSEQUENT STEP
      OF LISTING THE HOUSING UNITS FROM WHICH SAMPLE SELECTIONS
      ARE TO BE MADE, THE SRC SAMPLE DESIGN FURTHER DIVIDES THE
      SEGMENTS INTO SEGMENT PARTS, WHICH ARE IDENTIFIABLE UNITS
      WITHIN THE SEGMENT WITH A MEASURE OF SIZE OF APPROXIMATELY
      16 TO 20 HUS -- FOR EXAMPLE, A CITY BLOCK.

      EACH HU IN AN ACTIVE SEGMENT PART IS THEN LISTED AS A SAMPLE
      "LINE," AND FINAL HOUSEHOLD SELECTIONS ARE MADE WITH A
      RANDOM START AND A SYSTEMATIC SAMPLING PROCEDURE.

      ONCE A HOUSEHOLD IS SELECTED, ALL PERSONS RESIDING THERE ARE
      LISTED BY AN INTERVIEWER, AND A RESPONDENT IS CHOSEN, USING
      A SELECTION TABLE, FROM THE  POLITICALLY ELIGIBLE ADULTS IN
      THE HOUSEHOLD. (SEE VARIABLES 840037 AND 840070.)

      EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN THE UNITED STATES HAS AN EQUAL
      PROBABILITY OF FALLING INTO THE SAMPLE.  HOWEVER, ALL
      RESPONDENTS ARE NOT SELECTED WITH EQUAL PROBABILITY. FOR
      EXAMPLE, ONCE A HOUSEHOLD IS SELECTED, AN ELIGIBLE
      INDIVIDUAL IN A HOUSEHOLD WITH THREE ELIGIBLE PERSONS HAS
      ONLY ONE-THIRD THE PROBABILITY OF SELECTION AS THE PERSON
      WHO IS THE ONLY ELIGIBLE PERSON IN HIS/HER HOUSEHOLD.

      TECHNICALLY,  RESPONDENTS OUGHT TO BE WEIGHTED IN ALL
      ANALYSES BY THE INVERSE OF THEIR SELECTION PROBABILITY. NES
      STAFF HAS TRADITIONALLY COMPARED FREQUENCIES RUN WEIGHTED
      AND UNWEIGHTED ON VARIABLES OF INTEREST AND CONCLUDED THAT
      THE DIFFERENCES IN DISTRIBUTIONS (TYPICALLY VERY MINOR) DO
      NOT JUSTIFY THE ADDED COMPLEXITIES OF WEIGHTING. THIS IS THE
      CASE FOR 1984 AS WELL.  (SEE WORKING PAPER 6: WEIGHTING FOR
      THE 1984 PRE- AND POST-ELECTION SURVEYS.)

      FINALLY, THE FULL 1980 NATIONAL SAMPLE HAS 84 PRIMARY
      SELECTIONS, ONE FROM EACH STRATA.  IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FOR
      FLEXIBILITY IN SAMPLE DESIGN AND FOR EFFICIENCY IN STAFFING
      PRIMARY AREAS, THE SAMPLE DESIGN ALLOWS FOR USE OF 1/2, 2/3,
      5/6 OR ALL OF THE NON-SELF-REPRESENTING PRIMARY AREAS.  THIS
      FEATURE ALLOWS A SMALLER NUMBER OF PRIMARY AREAS TO BE USED
      FOR SMALLER SAMPLE SIZES, ENABLING MORE OPTIMAL
      COST/STATISTICAL EFFICIENCY THAN WOULD RESULT IF THE SAMPLE
      WERE SPREAD ACROSS THE FULL 84 PRIMARY AREAS.

      IN  PREVIOUS SRC SAMPLES, DESIRED INCREASES IN SAMPLE SIZE
      WERE HANDLED BY GENERATING ADDITIONAL LINES WITHIN A
      STANDARD SET OF SEGMENTS. IN THE CURRENT SAMPLING FRAME,
      ADDITIONAL PRIMARY AREAS AND/OR SEGMENTS WITHIN THE LARGEST
      PRIMARY AREAS ARE SELECTED TO INCREASE SAMPLE SIZE.

      THE NES USED THE 1/2 SAMPLE OPTION, WHICH MEANS THAT 11 OF
      THE 16 SELF-REPRESENTING PRIMARY AREAS AND 34 (1/2 OF 68) OF
      THE NON-SELF-REPRESENTING PRIMARY AREAS WERE USED, FOR A
      TOTAL OF 45 PRIMARY AREAS.  IN ADDITION TO FLEXIBILITY IN
      THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY AREAS WHICH MAY BE USED IN A SAMPLE,
      THE SRC SAMPLE DESIGN ALSO ALLOWS FOR FLEXIBILITY IN THE
      NUMBER OF SEGMENTS USED WITHIN EACH OF THE 6 LARGEST
      SELF-REPRESENTING PRIMARY AREAS.  EACH OF THESE AREAS IS
      DIVIDED INTO 4 SETS OF SEGMENTS, AVERAGING 6.25 SEGMENTS
      EACH.  ONE TO FOUR "SETS" OF SEGMENTS CAN BE USED AS
      NECESSARY. THE NUMBER OF SEGMENTS FROM THE REMAINING 39
      PRIMARY AREAS (5 SR, 34 NON-SR) IS EXACTLY SIX EACH.  THERE
      ARE 306 SEGMENTS IN THE SAMPLE; 72 FROM THE 6 LARGEST
      PRIMARY AREAS AND 234 FROM THE REMAINING ONES. WITH 2257
      INTERVIEWS, THERE ARE 6.1 INTERVIEWS ON AVERAGE PER SEGMENT.

      THE SAMPLE IS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN HEERINGA, STEVEN G.
      AND JUDITH H. CONNOR, 1980 SRC/NORC NATIONAL SAMPLE, ANN
      ARBOR: INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH, MAY 1985.




>> 1984 NOTE ON CANDIDATE NAME LIST


      THE _________________ EXPRESSIONS IN THE 1984 QUESTIONNAIRE
          (NAME # X, Y, OR Z)


      THE 1984 ELECTION STUDY QUESTIONNAIRE MADE PROVISIONS TO
      HAVE INTERVIEWERS FILL IN DISTRICT/STATE CANDIDATE NAMES IN
      BLANK SLOTS LIKE THE ONE DEPICTED ABOVE.  A COMPREHENSIVE
      LIST OF HOUSE AND SENATE CANDIDATE AND INCUMBENT NAMES WAS
      PREPARED FOR EACH OF THE 134 DISTRICTS IN THE SAMPLE AND THE
      INTERVIEWERS USED THE LISTS TO PRE-EDIT NAMES WHERE
      APPROPRIATE, DEPENDING ON THE DISTRICT OF INTERVIEW.  THESE
      CANDIDATE LISTS ARE REPRODUCED IN NOTE 13 IN THE NOTES
      SECTION.

      THE (NAME #) EXPRESSION WILL GENERALLY LIST MORE THAN ONE
      CANDIDATE NUMBER.  FOR ANY GIVEN DISTRICT, HOWEVER, ONE OF
      TWO POSSIBILITIES WILL HOLD: 1) THERE WILL BE ONE AND ONLY
      ONE NAME IN THE DISTRICT CANDIDATE LIST QUALIFYING FOR
      INCLUSION ON THE BASIS OF THE NUMBERS LISTED IN THE
      EXPRESSION; OR 2) THERE WILL BE NO NUMBER IN THE DISTRICT
      CANDIDATE LIST MATCHING ANY OF THE NUMBERS IN THE
      EXPRESSION.  AN INSTANCE OF NO MATCHING NUMBERS ARISES FOR A
      QUESTION ABOUT THE CANDIDATE CHALLENGING A DISTRICT
      INCUMBENT WHEN, IN FACT, THE INCUMBENT IS RUNNING UNOPPOSED.
      INTERVIEWERS WERE INSTRUCTED TO MARK "NO INFO" THOSE
      QUESTIONS INVOLVING UNMATCHED CANDIDATE NUMBERS IN THE (NAME
      #) EXPRESSION.

      IN THE CANDIDATE LIST, EACH CANDIDATE OR INCUMBENT IS
      ASSIGNED A NUMBER OR CODE.  NUMBERS BEGINNING WITH 1 (11-19)
      ARE FOR THE SENATE AND NUMBERS BEGINNING WITH 3 (31-39) ARE
      FOR THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.  IN ADDITION, THE CODE OR
      NUMBER ASSIGNED TO A NAME HAS AN INTRINSIC MEANING--IT
      DENOTES THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE OF THAT PERSON IN THE CONTEXT OF
      THE 1984 GENERAL ELECTIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, CANDIDATE NUMBER
      33 IS USED FOR A DEMOCRATIC HOUSE INCUMBENT SEEKING
      RE-ELECTION AND PLAYING, THEREFORE, THE DUAL ROLE OF HOUSE
      INCUMBENT AND DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR THE HOUSE OF
      REPRESENTATIVES IN THE 1984 ELECTIONS.  THE PRECISE MEANING
      OF EACH CANDIDATE NUMBER USED IN THE STUDY IS GIVEN IN NOTE
      13 IN THE NOTES SECTION.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, YOU WILL NEED TO
      UNDERSTAND THE SCHEME THAT WAS USED IN ORDER TO WORK
      EFFECTIVELY WITH QUESTIONS INVOLVING (NAME #) EXPRESSIONS.





>> 1984 INDIVIDUAL VOTER RECORD VALIDATION SECTION


          AS IN 1978 AND 1980, THE NATIONAL ELECTION STUDIES
      UNDERTOOK TO VALIDATE THE REPORTED VOTE OF RESPONDENTS.
      USERS SHOULD AT LEAST NOTE THE EXISTENCE OF VOTE VALIDATION
      DATA VARIABLES V841119 TO V841134 AS WELL AS THE REPORTED VOTE
      VARIABLES.

          BASICALLY, ALL PRE-ELECTION R'S WERE VALIDATED WITH THE
      EXCEPTIONS OF 1) R'S WHO TOLD US IN THE POST THAT THEY DID
      NOT VOTE AND WERE NOT REGISTERED AND 2) R'S WHO DID NOT GIVE
      US THEIR NAMES.

          DOCUMENTATION FOR THESE VARIABLES WILL BE MORE FULLY
      FLESHED OUT IN THE SECOND CONSORTIUM RELEASE.  ALSO, NES
      STAFF WILL PREPARE A WORKING PAPER ON VOTE VALIDATION OVER
      THE SUMMER.  MEANWHILE, CONSULTATION ON DEVELOPMENT AND USE
      OF THESE VARIABLES IS AVAILABLE FROM NES STAFF AT (313)
      764-5494.

>> 1984 CODEBOOK INFORMATION

The following example from the 1948 NES study provides the standard 
format for codebook variable documentation. 

Note that NES studies which are not part of the Time-Series usually
omit marginals and the descriptive content in lines 2-5 (except for
variable name).

Line 2 - VARIABLE NAME.  Note that in the codebook the variable name
         (usually a 'number') does not include the "V" prefix which is 
         used in the release SAS and SPSS data definition files
         (.sas and .sps files) for all variables including those
         which do not have 'number' names.  For example the variable
         "VERSION" in the codebook is "VVERSION" in the data definition
         files.

Line 2 - "NAME".  This is the variable label used in the SAS and SPSS
         data definition files (.sas and .sps files).  Some codebooks 
         exclude this.

Line 3 - COLUMNS.  Columns in the ASCII data file (.dat file).

Line 4 - CHARACTER OR NUMERIC.  If numeric and the variable is a decimal
         rather than integer variable, the numer of decimal places is 
         also indicated (e.g. "NUMERIC  DEC 4")

Line 5 - Values which are assigned to missing by default in the Study's
         SAS and and SPSS data definition files (.sas and .sps files).

Line 7 - Actual question text for survey variables or a description of 
         non-survey variables (for example, congressional district).
         Survey items usually include the question number (for example
         "B1a.") from the Study questionnaire; beginning in 1996 
         non-survey items also have unique item numbers (for example
         "CSheet.1").

Line 9 - A dashed or dotted line usually separates question text from
         any other documentation which follows.

Line 10- When present, annotation provided by Study staff is presented
         below the question text/description and preceding code values.

Lines 11-16
         Code values are listed with descriptive labels.  Valid codes
         (those not having 'missing' status in line 5) are presented
         first, followed by the values described in line 5.  For
         continuous variables, one line may appear providing the range
         of possible values.  A blank line usually separates the 'valid'
         and 'missing' values.

Lines 11-16
         Marginals are usually provided for discrete variables.  The
         counts may be unweighted or weighted; check the Study codebook
         introductory text to determine weight usage.
>> 1984 ICPSR PROCESSING INFORMATION


           THE DATA COLLECTION WAS PROCESSED ACCORDING TO THE
      STANDARD ICPSR PROCESSING PROCEDURES.  THE DATA WERE CHECKED
      FOR ILLEGAL OR INCONSISTENT CODE VALUES WHICH, WHEN FOUND,
      WERE RECODED TO OSIRIS MISSING DATA VALUES.  SOME
      CONSISTENCY CHECKS WERE PERFORMED.  STATEMENTS BRACKETED IN
      "<" AND ">" SIGNS IN THE BODY OF THE CODEBOOK WERE ADDED BY
      THE PROCESSORS FOR EXPLANATORY PURPOSES.
