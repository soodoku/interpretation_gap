NOTE ON VARIABLE NAMING:                                                      
                                                                              
The variable name references used in NES Study codebooks do not include       
the "V" prefix found in all variable names used within the released           
SAS and SPSS data definition files (.sas and .sps files).                     
                                                                              
For example, "VAR 920001" and "VAR VERSION" in Study codebooks refer to       
V920001 and VVERSION in the study data definition files.                      
                                                                              
                                                                              
VARIABLE 'NUMBERING':                                                         
                                                                              
'Numbered' variables in NES timeseries datasets and in Pilot datasets         
(except the 1998 Pilot) comply with the following format:                     
                                                                              
     2-digit year prefix  +  4 digits  +  [opt] 1-char suffix.                
                                                                              
Examples:  1978 Post variable V780002; 1983 Pilot variable V832101.           
Note that for datasets including data from multiple studies, the 2-digit      
year prefix corresponds to the appropriate study year to which the            
variable is associated; for example, the 1983 Pilot dataset also includes     
1982 timeseries variables, for which the 2-digit prefix is 82.                
                                                                              
Non-time-series studies other than Pilots use 2-character mnemonic            
prefixes, for example variable VPS0048 in the 1988-1990-1992 Pooled           
Senate Study dataset.                                                         
                                                                              
                                                                              
SPECIAL NOTE ON COLUMN LOCATIONS:

Some numeric variables use coding schemes that allow for code values
having a varying number of digits. In such instances, the number
of columns corresponding to the variable in the data file [.dat file] 
and in the column specifications  will be the width of the maximum value
occurring in the actual data, rather than the maximum width allowable
by the coding scheme.  For example, if codes 01-12 are allowed for a
numeric variable but all values in the data are less than 10, then the
number of columns corresponding to the variable within the ASCII data 
file will be 1.

                Q.G11. (R.B., P.5) RECENTLY THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK      
                ABOUT WOMEN'S RIGHTS. SOME PEOPLE FEEL THAT WOMEN SHOULD      
                HAVE AN EQUAL ROLE WITH MEN IN RUNNING BUSINESS, INDUSTRY,    
                AND GOVERNMENT.  SUPPOSE THESE PEOPLE ARE AT ONE END OF THE   
                SCALE AT POINT NUMBER 1. OTHERS FEEL THAT WOMEN'S PLACE IS    
                IN THE HOME.  SUPPOSE THESE PEOPLE ARE AT THE OTHER END AT    
                POINT 7.  AND, OF COURSE, SOME PEOPLE HAVE OPINIONS           
                SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN AT POINTS 2, 3, 4, 5, OR 6. WHERE WOULD  
                YOU PLACE YOURSELF ON THIS SCALE, OR HAVEN'T YOU THOUGHT      
                MUCH ABOUT THIS?

                Q.K5.(R.  B., P.7) I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR FEELINGS TOWARD SOME  
                OF OUR POLITICAL LEADERS AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE      
                NEWS THESE DAYS.  I WILL USE SOMETHING WE CALL THE FEELING    
                THERMOMETER AND HERE IS HOW IT WORKS: I'LL READ THE NAME OF   
                A PERSON AND I'D LIKE YOU TO RATE THAT PERSON USING THE       
                FEELING THERMOMETER.   RATINGS BETWEEN 50 DEGREES AND 100     
                DEGREES MEAN THAT YOU  FEEL FAVORABLE AND WARM TOWARD THE     
                PERSON.  RATINGS BETWEEN 0 DEGREES AND 50 DEGREES MEAN THAT   
                YOU DON'T FEEL FAVORABLE TOWARD THE PERSON AND THAT YOU       
                DON'T CARE TOO MUCH FOR THAT PERSON. IF WE COME TO A PERSON   
                WHOSE NAME YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE, YOU DON'T NEED TO RATE THAT   
                PERSON.  JUST TELL ME AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ONE. IF   
                YOU DO RECOGNIZE THE NAME, BUT YOU DON'T FEEL PARTICULARLY    
                WARM OR COLD TOWARD THE PERSON, YOU WOULD RATE THE PERSON AT  
                THE 50 DEGREE MARK.                                           
                                                                              
                Q.K5A. OUR FIRST PERSON IS RONALD REAGAN.  HOW WOULD YOU      
                RATE HIM USING THE THERMOMETER? (PROBE FOR "I DON'T KNOW"     
                RESPONSE: WHEN YOU SAY "DON'T KNOW" DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU      
                DON'T KNOW WHO THE PERSON IS, OR DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING ELSE   
                IN MIND?)

                NAME OF A PERSON AND I'D LIKE YOU TO RATE THAT PERSON USING   
                THE FEELING THERMOMETER.  RATINGS BETWEEN 50 DEGREES AND 100  
                DEGREES MEAN THAT YOU FEEL FAVORABLE AND WARM TOWARD THE      
                PERSON.  RATINGS BETWEEN 0 DEGREES AND 50 DEGREES MEAN THAT   
                YOU DON'T CARE TOO MUCH FOR THE PERSON. YOU WOULD RATE THE    
                PERSON AT THE 50 DEGREE MARK IF YOU DON'T FEEL PARTICULARLY   
                WARM OR COLD TOWARD THE PERSON. IF WE COME TO A PERSON WHOSE  
                NAME YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE, YOU DON'T NEED TO RATE THAT         
                PERSON. JUST TELL ME AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ONE. OUR

                Q.K1.  (R.B., P. 3) SOME PEOPLE THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD   
                PROVIDE FEWER SERVICES, EVEN IN AREAS SUCH AS HEALTH AND      
                EDUCATION, IN ORDER TO REDUCE SPENDING.  SUPPOSE THESE        
                PEOPLE ARE AT ONE END OF THE SCALE AT POINT NUMBER 1.  OTHER  
                PEOPLE FEEL IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE     
                MANY MORE SERVICES EVEN IF IT MEANS AN INCREASE IN SPENDING.  
                SUPPOSE THESE PEOPLE ARE AT THE OTHER END, AT POINT 7. AND,   
                OF COURSE, SOME OTHER PEOPLE HAVE OPINIONS SOMEWHERE IN

                WAY TO DEAL WITH RACIAL PROBLEMS.  SOME PEOPLE THINK          
                ACHIEVING RACIAL INTEGRATION OF SCHOOLS IS SO IMPORTANT THAT  
                IT JUSTIFIES BUSING CHILDREN TO SCHOOLS OUT OF THEIR OWN      
                NEIGHBORHOODS.  OTHERS THINK LETTING CHILDREN GO TO THEIR     
                NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS IS SO IMPORTANT THAT THEY OPPOSE         
                BUSING. WHERE WOULD YOU PLACE YOURSELF ON THIS SCALE OR       
                HAVEN'T YOU THOUGHT MUCH ABOUT THIS?

                "DISCOVERING JESUS CHRIST IN ONE'S LIFE."  THERE ARE DEEPLY   
                RELIGIOUS PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT HAD AN EXPERIENCE OF THIS

                        CONTAINS SOME HUMAN ERRORS.                           
               114  3.  THE BIBLE IS A GOOD BOOK BECAUSE IT WAS WRITTEN BY    
                        WISE MEN, BUT GOD HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.          
                31  4.  THE BIBLE WAS WRITTEN BY MEN WHO LIVED SO LONG AGO    
                        THAT IT IS WORTH VERY LITTLE TODAY.
