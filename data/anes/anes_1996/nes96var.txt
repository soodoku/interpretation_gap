              of contacting or conducting interviews with respondents,        
              NES has, since 1984, followed a strategy of releasing Pre-      
              election sample in stages.  In 1996 the sample was              
              released in four quarter samples at approximately two week      
              intervals.  The allocation of sample lines to target            
              periods was random, at the segment level; the sets of           
              assigned lines are known as replicates.  Dates of release       
              were as follows:  1st replicate 9/3, 2nd replicate 9/12,        
              3rd replicate 9/26, 4th replicate 10/10.  Panel cases that      
              required tracking because the current address of the            
              respondent was not known were released with the first           
              replicate.  Two replicates of cross-section cases were          
              designated as 'reserve' to release as needed, depending on      
              an evaluation of sample performance prior to the release        
              of replicate 3.  The reserve replicates of cross-section        
              cases were released as follows:  replicate 5 with               
              replicate 3 and replicate 6 with replicate 4.

              The Selection Table is used to select a respondent from         
              all household members who are eligible adults.  (An             
              eligible adult is a U.S. citizen who is 18 years of age or      
              older by Election Day.)  The Selection Table appears on         
              the Coversheet below the Household Listing.                     
              After a complete listing of the HH is taken, each eligible      
              adult is assigned a "Number" based on the criteria of           
              gender and age [beginning with the oldest male as number        
              1, males are numbered by increments of 1 according to           
              descending age; females are numbered by descending age          
              starting with the number one higher than that assigned          
              to the youngest male].  The interviewer then uses the           
              Selection Table to determine the "Number" of the eligible       
              adult to be interviewed.                                        
              The Selection Table itself consists of 2 parallel               
              total number  of eligible adults in the household; in the       
              second column (same row) is identified the Number" of the       
              person who will be the respondent.                              
              There are 8 different Selection Tables used and they are        
              randomly assigned. [Note that although only 8 tables are        
              used, there are 12 codes in this variable because the 8         
              tables are used in cycles of 12; this procedure is used to      
              equalize the probability of selection for each eligible         
              adult].  A summary describing all 8 Selection Tables            
              appears below.

              of MSAs included in the NECMA definition that are not in        
              the CMSA/MSA definition.  For example, in Boston MA (1990

              Boston MSA but some from other New England MSAs -- some of      
              which could be outside of the Boston CMSA definition and        
              could be coded `2'.  It also means that in the Manchester-

              For the Panel component, this variable refers to R's            
              location when originally selected in 1992 or 1994; the          
              respondent may have moved since then.  For the Cross-           
              section component, this reflects R's location where             
              selected in 1996.                                               
              Coded according to the 1990 Census.  The major objective        
              of the Census Bureau in delineating urbanized areas is to       
              provide a better separation of urban and rural population       
              in the vicinity of large citites.  An urbanized area            
              consists of a central city or cities, and surrounding           
              closely settled territory ("urban fringe").  Size of Place      
              codes 21 and 41 include areas that are in the "urban            
              fringe" but are not Census Places.                              
              Note for Codes 50-53:  in a few cases, Non-MSA PSUs (based      
              on the 1980 OMB SMSA definitions) contain areas which are       
              now part of a 1990 PMSA or MSA (based on the June 1990 OMB      
              definition).  In these cases, the Size of Place Code for        
              any SSUs (segments) within such areas are coded in the          
              "40s" rather than in the "50s" as shown.  This occurred in      
              El Dorado county CA (the major part of the El                   
              Dorado/Alpine Co, CA PSU #82) which is now a part of the        
              Sacramento CA MSA, and also for one SSU (segment) in the

              For Panel respondents who moved since their original NES        
              contact (1992, 1994), the data corresponding to their           
              original sampling address was coded here.                       
              These SMSA codes were obtained from the Federal                 
              Information Processing Standard Publication, U.S.               
              Department of Commerce, National Bureau of Standards.           
              The 1980 SMSA Codes have for the most part been carried         
              over by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to the        
              1990 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA's).  However,          
              some MSA names and definitions have been modified by OMB        
              to reflect shifts in population and changes in                  
                                                                              
              SMSA codes have been retained for all parts of the MSA          
              primary sampling units (PSU's).  It should be remembered        
              that, particularly in the case of PMSAs (which are part of      
              consolidated areas (or CMSAs) some counties or county           
              parts may in 1990 be defined by OMB as part of a different      
              PMSA (a good example is Chicago, IL).  It was felt that         
              for NES analysis, to retain the older SMSA codes, which         
              correspond to the 1980 sampling frame used for the panel        
              component of this sample, was most appropriate for all MSA      
              or PMSA areas in that component.                                
              In those areas designated "Non-SMSA" in our sample frame        
              ("Non-MSA" on most of our documentation for 1996 NES),          
              there are two PSUs (#464, Gardner, MA, and #482, El             
              Dorado/Alpine, CA) in which some of the 1980 rural area         
              has in 1990 met the requirements for inclusion in an MSA;       
              in these cases the size of place code was modified to           
              reflect this and the 1990 MSA number is indicated for the       
              affected segments (segment 009 in Gardner, MA, used in

              were Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSAs)            
              became in 1990 either Metropolitan Statistical Areas            
              (MSAs) or Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas                
              (PMSAs).   MSA is used for a metropolitan area which            
              stands alone, i.e., is not a part of a Consolidated             
              Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA).  PMSA is used for a       
              metropolitan area which is part of a larger CMSA.               
              The metropolitan area standards for the 1990's generally        
              reflect a continuity with those adopted for the 1980's and      
              maintain the basic concepts originally developed in 1950.       
              The few substantive changes made between 1980 and 1990 are      
              detailed in the Federal Register, Vol. 55, No.62 cited in       
              the footnote.                                                   
              New England County Metropolitan Areas (NECMAs) provide an       
              alternative to the official city-and-town based                 
              metropolitan statistical areas in that Census region for        
              the convenience of data users who desire a county-defined       
              set of areas.  NECMAs have their separate definition            
              standards detailed in the Federal Register (p. 12159).          
              Since the 1990 SRC National Sample primary stage of             
              selection was based on the NECMA in New England, the 1990       
              NECMA  is provided in place of 1990 MSA or PMSA for this        
              variable.  For consistency, New England Panel segments          
              which are a part of a 1990 NECMA  also have the NECMA           
              coded here.  NECMA numbers end with the numeral 3.

              CD at which R was located during the Pre interview, since

              registration since the Pre; moreover, in most cases Rs who      
              moved between the Pre and Post were primarily exposed to        
              the House campaigns of the candidates identified according

              It was not systematically determined whether a new Post         
              address was in a CD different from Pre CD unless R's new        
              location was a different state.  All cases where R was

         I'd like to get your feelings toward some of our                     
         political leaders and other people who are in the news               
         these days.  I'll read the name of a person and I'd like             
         you to rate that person using something we call the                  
         feeling thermometer.                                                 
         Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you             
         feel favorable and warm toward the person.  Ratings                  
         between 0 and 50 degrees mean that you don't feel                    
         favorable toward the person and that you don't care too              
         much for that person.  You would rate the person at the              
         50 degree mark if you don't feel particularly warm or                
         cold toward the person.  If we come to a person whose                
         name you don't recognize, you dn't need to rate the                  
         person.  Just tell me and we'll move on to the next one.

         There is much concern about the rapid rise in medical                
         and hospital costs.  Some people feel there should be a              
         government insurance plan which would cover all medical              
         and hospital expenses for everyone.  (Suppose these                  
         people are at one end of a scale, at point 1).  Others               
         feel that all medical expenses should be paid by                     
         individuals and through private insurance plans like                 
         Blue Cross or some other company paid plans.  (Suppose               
         these people are at the other end, at point 7).  And, of             
         course, some other people have opinions somewhere in                 
         between at points 2,3,4,5, or 6.

         should make every effort to improve the social and

         the government should not make any special effort to                 
         help blacks because they should help themselves.

         There has been some discussion about abortion during                 
         recent years.                                                        
         Which one of the opinions on this page best agrees with              
         your view?  You can just tell me the number of the                   
         opinion you choose.                                                  
         1. By law, abortion should never be permitted.                       
         2. The law should permit abortion ONLY in case of rape,              
            incest or when the woman's life is in danger.                     
         3. The law should permit abortion for reasons OTHER THAN             
            rape, incest or danger to the woman's life, but only              
            after the need for the abortion has been clearly                  
            established.                                                      
         4. By law, a woman should always been able to obtain an              
            abortion as a matter of personal choice

         environment even if it costs some jobs or otherwise

         living.  (Suppose these people are at the other end of

         Recently there has been a lot of talk about women's                  
         rights.  Some people feel that women should have an                  
         equal role with men in running business, industry, and               
         government.  (Suppose these people are at one end of a               
         scale, at point 1.)  Others feel that a woman's place is             
         in the home.  (Suppose these people are at the other                 
         end, at point 7.)  And, of course, some other people                 
         have opinions somewhere in between, at points 2,3,4,5 or

         People have different ideas about the government in                  
         Washington.  These ideas don't refer to Democrats or                 
         Republicans in particular, but just to the GOVERNMENT IN             
         GENERAL.  We want to see how you feel about these                    
         ideas.  For example:                                                 
         How much of the time do you think you can trust the                  
         government in Washington to do what is right--

              coded 10,17,18,20 in Y17(1), and represents PAST                
              employment of spouses coded 15,16,40,50,60 in Y17(1).  Rs       
              coded 70,75,80 in Y17(1) are Inap [see Y17e/f(2) for            
              employment within past 6 months].                               
              The administration of spouse/partner employment questions       
              differed from previous years in that a separate 'series'        
              of questions was not administered for each employment           
              status.  Because a single set of questions describing R's       
              occupation, industry, and hours of work was administered        
              regardless of employment status, the traditional "stack"        
              variables have not been constructed.  However, for greater      
              consistency with the "stack" format, there are 2 sets of        
              variables representing questions Y17e/f, Y17fx(1),              
              Y17fx(2), Y17g, Y17h, the first excluding occupation            
              description information for nonworking homemakers/students      
              who have worked in the last 6 months (but describing all        
              others), and the second providing occupation data only for      
              spouses in this category.  "Stack" variables traditionally      
              omitted this data.                                              
              Note:  if spouse was both currently working and retired or      
              disabled, the interviewer may have asked (or the                
              respondent may have preferred to respond) in terms of           
              either current OR past employment for occupation                
              description [Y17e/f, Y17fx(1),Y17fx(2)], industry               
              description [Y17g], and number of hours worked [Y17h].          
              Reviewing the cases which fall into these employment            
              status categories, it appears that most cases describe          
              past employment, in conformity with employment                  
              descriptions for nonworking retirees/ disabled.  However,       
              cases 1945,2298,3161,3298 were ambiguous and have been          
              coded 99 NA in this variable.  The occupation codes which       
              would have been otherwise assigned to these cases are,          
              respectively, 30, 22,48,71.                                     
              The original 3-digit 1980 US Census Occupation variable         
              has been recoded into 71 subgroups, in order to protect         
              Respondents' anonymity.  Contact NES Project Staff for

              regardless of employment status, the traditional "stack"        
              variables have not been constructed.  However, for greater

              Reviewing the cases which fall into these employment

              The administration of spouse/partner employment questions

              occupation, industry, and hours of work was administered        
              regardless of employment status, the traditional "stack"        
              variables have not been constructed.  However, for greater      
              consistency with the "stack" format, there are 2 sets of

              spouses in this category.  "Stack" variables traditionally      
              omitted this data.

              Rs who do not live with a family member age 14 or older         
              were not asked this question.  Their response to Y21 was        
              duplicated in this variable.                                    
              Note that in 53 cases, due to interviewer error in the Y19      
              checkpoint administration, the Y20 family income question       
              was not administered although R was not the only household      
              member aged 14 and older.  These cases have been coded NA;      
              their individual income data have not been duplicated here.     
              Additional note:  In 14 cases, interviewers entered             
              responses where R's individual income (Y20a/Y21) was            
              higher than family income (Y20) [case IDs 1134, 1239,

              exceptions.  In 39 cases, the early training VQ was used        
              in error.  The significant effects of this error were the       
              following 1) absence of randomization 2) D11x instruction       
              changed from "SHOW BALLOT CARD" to "DO NOT SHOW BALLOT          
              CARD" 3) questions F3 and F4 skipped.  In the Pre and Post      
              randomization variables, the unrandomized order in which        
              the questions were administered is coded for these cases,       
              and the half-sample checkpoints identify the

              This refers to interviews initially refused by someone          
              when an interviewer was first attempting contact.  The          
              source of this refusal may or may not have been the             
              Respondent.                                                     
              Conversion may be made by the initial interviewer or            
              another interviewer.  If the conversion is not made by the      
              initial interviewer, the interviewer of record is the           
              interviewer obtaining the conversion.

         I'd like to get your feelings toward some of our                     
         political leaders and other people who are in the news               
         these days. I'll read the name of a person and I'd like              
         you to rate that person using something we call the                  
         feeling thermometer.                                                 
         Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you             
         feel favorable and warm toward the person.  Ratings                  
         between 0 degrees and 50 degrees mean that you don't                 
         feel favorable toward that person and that you don't                 
         care too much for that person.  You would rate the                   
         person at the 50 degree mark if you don't feel                       
         particular warm or cold toward the person.                           
         If we come to a person whose name you don't recognize,               
         you don't need to rate that person.  Just tell me and                
         we'll move on to the next one.

         a lot of people were not able to vote because they                   
         weren't registered, they were sick, or they just didn't              
         have time.  How about you--did you vote in the

              Unlike previous years, and through an error in the              
              questionnaire, nonvoters not registered in the county of        
              interview were not asked the same version of this question      
              as nonvoters who were registered in the county of               
              interview.  Thus, all 'out of county' nonvoters (17 cases)      
              were not shown a ballot card (second version of question).      
              Specifically regarding 'out of county' nonvoters who may        
              have been registered in a CD different from the CD of           
              interview:   in past studies, all nonvoters were asked for      
              preference among candidates within the CD of interview,         
              regardless of where they were registered, and the ballot        
              card for CD of interview was presented to R.  In 1996 no        
              ballot card was shown and no other identification of CD         
              for candidate preference was offered to nonvoters               
              registered in a different CD.  Among the 17 'out of             
              county' nonvoters, no clear indication was found within         
              respondents' answers of preference for candidates from CDs      
              other than CD of interview, however it is unclear how the       
              'out of county' nonvoter responses would have differed if       
              the ballot card had been shown.

         Some people say that because of past discrimination,                 
         blacks should be given preference in hiring and                      
         promotion.  Others say that such preference in hiring                
         and promotion of blacks is wrong because it gives blacks             
         advantages they haven't earned.

         preferential hiring and promotion of blacks?

         government should not make any special effort to help                
         blacks because they should help themselves.  Suppose                 
         these people are at the other end, at point 7. And, of               
         course, some other people have opinions somewhere in

         Some people think that if a company has a history of                 
         discriminating against blacks when making hiring                     
         decisions, then they should be required to have an                   
         affirmative action program that gives blacks preference              
         in hiring.

         discriminated against blacks have to have an affirmative

         extremely liberal to extremely conservative.

         [RB] In the first statement a score of 1 means that you              
         think almost all of the people in that group tend to be              
         "hard-working." A score of 7 means that you think most               
         people in the group are "lazy."  A score of 4 means that             
         you think that most people in the group are not closer               
         to one end or the other, and of course, you may choose               
         any number in between.

               For every group category, there are 5 category summary         
               variables which correspond to 1)-5) above.  Each of the        
               category summary variables is descriptive of all mentions      
               (up to 4 specific groups) for the particular category.

         In some countries, people believe their elections are                
         conducted fairly.  In other countries, people believe                
         that their elections are conducted unfairly.                         
         Thinking of the last election in the United States,                  
         where would you place it on this scale of one to five                
         where 1 means that the last election was conducted

         make our political system work in the United States.                 
         Others think that political parties are not needed in                
         the United States.                                                   
         Using the scale in the booklet, (where 1 means that                  
         political parties are necessary to make our political                
         system work, and 5 means that political parties are not              
         needed in the United States), where would you place                  
         yourself?

         Looking at page 18 in the booklet.                                   
         I'd like to know what you think about each of our                    
         political parties.                                                   
         After I read the name of a political party, please rate              
         it on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means you strongly               
         dislike that party and 10 means that you strongly like               
         that party.  If I come to a party you haven't heard of               
         or you feel you do not know enough about, just say so.

         And now, using the same scale, I'd like to ask you how               
         much you like or dislike some political leaders. Again,              
         if I come to a leader you haven't heard of or you feel               
         you do not know enough about, just say so.                           
         The first political leader is                                        
         Bill Clinton.
