ANES 2008 Ethnicity Master code


The ANES Ethnicity Master Code applies to:

1. Mentions given in response to the standard open-ended ethnicity question
   ("In addition to being American, what do you consider your main ethnic
   group or nationality group?");

2. The single mention response to the ethnicity 'choice' followup question
   ("With which of these groups do you most closely identify?") that is
   asked of respondents who had given more than 1 ethnic group in response
   to 1.

Note that code 890 applies to respondents who specifically indicate
ethnicity as 'American' only, even though question wording indicates "In
addition to being American...".
